      "reviewText": "I bought this for a tv that wouldn't work with any other universal remote (isymphony). the remote for the tv had small numbers and my dad needed something with bigger numbers and arrows. with this remote you put it nose to nose with the original and are able to program from the original remote. a little time consuming, but well worth it-now my elderly father can actually use the tv with a remote!! I looked around alot (on line)-there are many learning remotes-some very expensive-didn't know if this would even work-so I bought a cheap one-it works great for this purpose. so, if your loved one goes to a nursing home with ridiculous remotes and odd brands of tvs-this is definately what you need!!!!",

      "reviewText": "I am not using this remote for normal applications. I lost a remote to a pedastal fan. I had another one just like it. So, I got this remote for the learning function and because it was cheap. I used the one fan remote I had left to \"teach\" this remote those functions. It worked quite well. I solved the problem with this remote instead of having to go buy another fan for $30-$40.",

      "reviewText": "This is a nice remote with large buttons, and easy to use. However, we had to call the company about some problems we were having, and were informed that they had removed several features, including the learning feature, and the digital sub channel feature, and others, but have not changed the information, or the product number, and have not informed the dealers.\nWe wanted it for the learning feature, but have decided to keep it. It would be nice if it were advertised for what it is, and I think Walmart should contact the manufacturers about this misrepresentation.",
