      "reviewText": "There are a couple of things you need to know. First and foremost, the \"Battery Charger\" they give you should be thrown in the trash. I think the majority of complaints about the battery life stems from the charger, which isn't really a charger, just an AC/DC adapter that is not suited to charge a battery. You need something that automatically shuts off when the battery is full. If you don't already own a trickle charger, go buy one. I have a Battery Tender Jr that I use.\n\nI also feel the battery is on the small side and could benefit from a larger one, or do what I did and wire in a second battery.\n\nSecond, as mentioned before, when you assemble the car, the L and R markings are reversed. Not sure if they were assuming the car would be upside down so they marked it like that or what.\n\nOther than that, it's been a great little car. It has rubber strips in the center of the tires so it's pretty quiet on pavement, something not found on more expensive brands. I like the 2 speeds and the little gear shifter with boot. For the price (even adding in the cost of a trickle charger) it's a great value for the money. The overall construction is good too. The plastic is of a good quality. The kids have rammed the car in the curb a few times not paying attention or goofing around and nothing is cracked yet. The white hides the scratches well.\n\nI did some modification to ours. In addition to the 2nd battery, I added a working brake pedal, LED headlights and LED tailights. See pictures of the results. (Note: This is only for people who know what they are doing)",

      "reviewText": "I bought this for my three year old grandson and like so many others we had an issue with the battery charging. I called the manufacturer and was told what steps to take to clear the lines so the battery would charge correctly. I'm not sure I remember them step by step but I had to disconnect the red battery wires at the white connector, make sure the switch was in the on position and press on the gas pedal for 20 seconds. I recharged the battery for 8 hours and the car has worked great since then.",

      "reviewText": "My mother purchased two of these cars for our children last christmas. The children could not ride for 10 minutes without the battery going dead. We intially thought maybe we didn't allow it to charge long enough, but after charging it for almost 24hrs it did the exact same thing. I would say that maybe we bought a lemon, but for two cars to do the same thing is more than a lemon; it is absolutely ridiculous. This is an item that you can apply the old saying \" You get what you pay for!\" I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to purchase one of these for their children.",
