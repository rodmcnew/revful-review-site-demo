      "reviewText": "After years of looking for something to move the TV sound closer and make voices more distinct at a price a working person can afford Serene Innovations has come through. We no longer fight over the volume control on the remote. It has everything I need in a nice looking retro package. Worked first time right out of the box and took only a minute to hook up. I added a separate power supply so now the speaker never leaves my table. Fixing to add an additional speaker for a truly custom TV sound system at a price everyone can afford. Where were you guys 10 years ago?",
