      "reviewText": "We had an Intex metal frame that weeds would grow through the liner even though we sprayed the area and used the included tarp with the pool. We bought a new Intex ultra frame at the beginning of the summer. This liner pad is keeping the weeds from growing through. It's very thin, but it's doing the job. It's worth the extra money & time to get this & set it up before setting up the pool.",
