      "reviewText": "I own two the the Neato Robatic vacuums. They have been running every day for more than two years. I use the pet and allergy brushes as I also have two dogs and a cat. While I recommend the standard brush if you do not have pets, I highly recommend the pet and allergy brushes if you have pets. The same applies for the allergy filter. While the standard filter is very good the allergy filter captures far more of the allergens.",

The vac USED to sometimes get stuck where the hard floors meet the carpet, but I think this kits adds a little more traction to the vac, (an unintentional benefit).",
