Once it was assembled, it looks goooood. We have a 50\" flat screen and it looks like it was made for this stand. Fits perfectly. I'm very happy with it. Could not be more pleased.",

      "reviewText": "This TV stand looks like you spent a fortune on it. It is 100x nicer than the picture. The glass shelves are solid black. The weight limit for the top shelf is 150 lbs, middle and bottom shelves is 65 lbs each. Spacing between the shelves is approx 7 inches. The edge of the top shelf sits back approx 6 inches from the edge of the middle shelf so you can put taller items (vase or something maybe) on the middle shelf.",

Walmart.com had it for me at nearly half the $ of other online retailers and even with their outrageous Hawai`i surcharge it was still cheaper.",
