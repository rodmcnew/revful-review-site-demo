      "reviewText": "I have used Mobil Delvac 1300 for years.. I have a Freightliner Classic XL , with the 500 Hp Detroit engine. I've got over 1,100,000 Miles on the engine and never replaced the piston liners or pistons.. I replaced the engine head at just over 1 million miles and Detroit Service, said that i should run it another 600,000 miles or so and then think about a rebuild..\nI use Mobil Delvac , in every auto and lawn and garden engine that i own...\n\nThank you..",

The surprise is that I was using a much higher priced oil that did not deliver the power that this oil does. Nice sideline benefit! www.heatingandairfilters.com",
