Why? the same reason as many other have said you seem to not care what we are telling you like. We are telling you because WE WANT to buy your products!Tiger Lily which you evidently choice to \"Kill\" was the most attractive and universally flattering color of all. I know, I own every color!\n\nProduct Manager - Please Hear Us!\n\n1. BRING BACK TIGER LILY.. It was perfect!\n2. Carmel Daisy makes you look like you died 3 days ago?! Blue and Brown lips?? Why,...\n3. Why even make Red lip balms... Really? Red is for a full-cover product in a Balm it just looks creepy\n\n4. Hibiscus is Pretty Good, But I can never find it???\n\nThe stores don't seem to re-stock your products. Don't you want us to buy.. You should most definitely make it easy for them to restock.\n\nI really hope you are listening?! Please bring Back Tiger Lily or sell me the remaining stock??\n\nFrom: A 43 year Old Professional Woman (who is trying to be a loyal customer - but challenged by your Product decisions)",

It's moisturizing and the color is just enough. It's not to much or too little that you couldn't tell. I use pink blossom.",

      "reviewText": "I am a huge fan of tinted lip balms, but many of them are disappointing. Sometimes they aren't moisturizing enough and others the color is awful. This one is great! I own all of the colors except Tiger Lily, which I am planning on getting soon. Currently, Rose is my very favorite and may buy an extra to keep in my purse at all times. I have to echo the comments on packaging. The cardboard tube is just ridiculous, especially when ALL your other lip products aren't done this way.",
