      "reviewText": "I was forced to buy this battery for my alpha 55 SLT camera, since the battery that came with the camera lasted on for approx 400 shots (this was as mentioned by sony, no surprises) with 18-55 kit lens. I was going on a vacation and was not sure if I would have the option to recharge the battery regularly. The other features of the camera were nice so I just didn't care much about the battery life at that time. I am repenting now!!\n\nNow, with the new 70400G lens which I have purchased, the battery lasts hardly for 200 shots!!!!!\n\nIts my bad. I didn't give enough consideration to battery life.\n\nThis is a good battery for point and shoot cameras BUT not for SLR/SLT/NEX cameras!! Please make note of this, before deciding to buy these cameras!!! I am learning it the hard way\n\nI have heard that sony is coming up with new models in the near future which have a different battery and give excellent battery life.\n\nBut I am screwed!! After so much investment I can't even go to a different brand ($1000 for camera+$1600 for lens$80 for battery)",

      "reviewText": "I love my nex5 camera, but the battery pack has a very short life.. I took a few photos one day and i had to charge it again next day.. its like every time you do a session you make sure you either have another battery or charge it for a few hours. The price of $80 is quite high, as with everything sony.",

      "reviewText": "When I first purchased this camera, the battery probably lasted about 50 photos. I've had this camera roughly a year now and the battery life is down to 20-30 photos. When using a flash, the battery life numbers should be cut in half. Today after fully charging the battery all night, I took five pictures using the flash and the battery was down to 19%. It is ridiculous, please make an add-on battery pack for this camera. I don't normally post reviews but specifically created a Sony account here so I could post this.",

      "reviewText": "I have a NEX 5K for a year now.\n\nPurchased an extra battery soon after getting the camera. Just returned from 3 week in Africa and prior to leaving purchased another battery. This gave me 2 while on game drives and one back in camp charging.\n\nMost of the time, the battery lasted for 8 hours of of the 2 game drives. Only twice did I have to swap batteries during a game drive.\nNo power at night to charge the batteries.\n\nMost of my photography is stills not movies.\n\nNo matter what camera you own, digital photography uses battery power. One should have no less than 2 batteries to insure you have power during your days picture taking.",
