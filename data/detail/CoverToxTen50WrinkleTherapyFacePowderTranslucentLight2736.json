I've been using it now for about 2 years and have gotten more compliments on how young I look and how young my skin looks. The powder goes on smooth, stays and doesn't cake. I really have no need to reapply throughout the day because of it's staying power. AND it lasts forever! So the price is just price for what you get and the length of time it lasts.",

      "reviewText": "I've been using this for a couple of years. I'm 58 years old now. It's the best powder for me at my age. It doesn't sink into my wrinkles -- It stays on top. And it doesn't look cakey. It skims on smoothly and lightly. If I'm in a hurry I just use it by itself and it looks great. If I want a \"going out in the evening more makeup look\" I wear it over my foundation and it works well that way, too. I love it!",

      "reviewText": "I am 39 years old and luckily don't have too many wrinkles yet, but I do have the dreaded forehead wrinkle which is more pronounced some days than others for whatever reason. I wasn't happy with how my makeup looked so I recently changed foundation and powder. This powder is the best I have ever used. It doesn't settle into my forehead wrinkle and it's barely noticeable on my skin. It's very lightweight on the skin, so you don't feel smothered by the makeup.",
