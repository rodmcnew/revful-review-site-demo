      "reviewText": "I had never tried this brand before for a brownie mix but knew this was a good name brand. So I gave it a try and bought the package. My 16 year old son made the brownies one afternoon. When finished baking, the whole house had the sweetest aroma. We all had a brownie for a snack, while watching a TV movie together. We all agreed that these brownies are the best ones we've tried. They were so moist, had a cake like consistency and chewy. The taste is so rich without being overly sweetened. And a plus with the chocolate chips already in the mix, but not too many of them. Well, we finished off the pan of brownies in one day and have purchased another box for next week's treat. These brownies are easy to make - 1/4 cup water, 1/3 cup vegetable oil and 1 egg. These are a premium brownie, not your regular brownie in a box. These are bakery quality.",
