The door screeched when opened until I loaded it up with oil. I now smell oil each time I open the door but it stopped screeching.\nCooks like a microwave",

      "reviewText": "Have been using this unit for two months now and am very satified with it's performance and features. It does an excellent job and is very quite. Keypad layout and functions are good although it would be nice to have the power level button closer to the Cook button since they are frequently used together. They only feature I miss is not having a turntable off button. I realize this is a lower end model, but this is a simple feature that could easily be ported to these units. However, I do like that the turntable is large and fills the space better than most other units we looked at.\nTwo caveats, one, this is not a simple unit to install. A handy DIY would probably be OK, but if you don't assemble many products and use power tools on a reqular bais, have it professionally installed. The last thing is something everyone complains about, the three beeps at the end of every cook/timer cycle. The three beeps wouldn't be that bad if they were softer or would stop when you opened the door or hit Stop, but they continue, loudly.\nAll that said, I would buy this unit again. Price/Performance far out way the few negatives.",
