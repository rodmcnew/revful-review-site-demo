      "reviewText": "I bought the bike assembled from the store. I have never had a mountain bike before, thought it would be a nice starter bike. Rode it briefly 2 times worked fine except rear brake seemed weak, had to use both rear and front brake to come to a stop. On the 3rd ride the rear wheel shifted and started rubbing on the frame to were it would no longer turn. I loosed the wheel and adjusted it to were it would turn but now I have no rear brakes. I will be returning the bike as I have only had it one week.",

      "reviewText": "I have owned six of the Next Power X and PX 6.0 bikes since 2005 and will soon be buying my 7th one. With the slime Smart Tube double thick inner tubes put on free by the great Wal*Mart bike builders, I have never had a flat. Biking is my primary transport and Next has come through big time. Not only is this a class look dependable bike but it is extreme value at $100. Three of the six bikes have had problems after initial assembly, one had to be replaced which Wal*Mart graciously did. Since the two problems came up in the first 90 days the wonderful Wal*Mart bike builders spent all the time necessary to get the bike working perfectly. Over and above all of this, Next, upon providing documentation, replaces broken parts for the first year of ownership. They recently sent me to handle bar grips and a back reflector for a bike that was 11.5 months old. Next/Bridgeway has become a supr fav company for me along with the likes of Wal*Mart and Legal Shield.",
