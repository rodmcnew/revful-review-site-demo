      "reviewText": "I recently purchased one of these for a desktop computer I had running as a file/media server. With this server, I needed an extra Ethernet interface to work with. Needless to say, this adapter did the trick wonderfully. Being, fast, reliable, and easy to install, this adapter was doing its job in no time at all. When transferring large files to and from my server, I notice near 100 Mbps speeds and have experienced no problems so far. This is a very solid little adapter at a bargain of a price. A++ all the way!",
