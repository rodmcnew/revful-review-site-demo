      "reviewText": "We've only had this camera for 3 days but so far it seems to be great. I bought it for my wife and she is a techno-phobe so I am always worried when I buy her something electronic. But she signed up for a photography class at the local community college that starts next month and I didn't think her point and shoot camera would fit the bill for her class so I decided to buy her a camera to use in the class. At any rate, so far she's thrilled with the Samsung NX 1100. I have gone through the user's manual and taken a few pictures myself and I really like the camera. I especially like that there is an option to buy a lens adapter so we can buy other than Samsung lenses for the camera. I also like the WiFi capability to send the photos directly from the camera to my wife's iPhone.\n\nAfter reading reviews online, I knew this was the camera for our purposes, i.e., entry level SLR and I was amazed that Walmart.com beat Best Buy's price by $200 and I had it shipped to our local Walmart store so I didn't have to pay shipping. Made it a no brainer. For less than $300 you can't beat this camera, IMHO.",
