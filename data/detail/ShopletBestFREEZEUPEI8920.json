      "reviewText": "My girls (ages 10 and 7) really love this game. It makes them think quickly and is a lot of fun. The only down side (and this is minuscule) is that, while there are hundreds of categories, you do get asked the same questions more than you should. We solved that quickly by making a rule that you can't repeat answers that others have already given. That actually made the game more fun and a little more challenging. The game is fun for the whole family and is GREAT for long car trips.",
