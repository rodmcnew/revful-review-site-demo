But it was -- I have never had such performance from any set of tires ever and why would I even think of getting anything else again? These are on a Chevy Blazer that likes to run up and down the Florida Turnpike at 85 mph day after day. Another feature - they grip the road so well I can stop that SUV on a dime or make a hairpin turn without breaking traction. Think about it.",

      "reviewText": "The immediate predecessor of this tire (same exact name and rating, except the word \"Radial\" was used instead of \"Tour\") was standard equipment on my 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe All-wheel Drive Traction Control ABS SUV.\n\nThe tires are quiet, but grip the road quite well.\n\nIn fact, the handling of my Hyundai Santa Fe, with these tires, is better than the handling of my 1998 Volvo S70 Turbo with its \"performance\" Michelin tires, and that is saying a lot.\n\nThe \"T/A Tour\" tires reportedly are a little noisier than the \"Radial T/A\" tires. I think can live with that.\n\nI presently have more than 55,000 miles on my first set of \"Radial T/A\" tires, and will be due for replacement within the next year. Not because the tires will be worn out, but just because they will then be thirteen years old.",
