      "reviewText": "My family went camping and brought this with us. I pre-charged this prior to our three day trip and it lasted the whole time (although, we only turned it on when needed at night). It’s great that it can be charged in the car if I wanted to since it comes with an AC and DC adapter.\n\nThe flashlight can be easily turned into a worklight by simply pulling the top head and handle apart from each other. Most of the time, we only used the 27 LED worklight feature. What’s funny is that when I busted this out during the camping trip, the kids came towards me and wanted to use the worklight! They thought it was so cool because it was so bright. Just be careful not to shine it against your eyes. For a compact flashlight like this, it is pretty powerful.",
