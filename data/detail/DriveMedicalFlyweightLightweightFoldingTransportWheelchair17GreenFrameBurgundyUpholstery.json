My mom is 4'8\" and her legs are short, and this chair fits her very well. This chair is very easy to move around tight areas, and is light weight for a wheel chair. The wheel brakes work excellent.\nFor those who are interested, the chair is rated for up to 200 lbs.",

      "reviewText": "I bought this for my dad for his 75th birthday as he will soon be undergoing knee replacement surgery and needs something to get around in. This is a great transport chair. It easily folds to fit our small trunk, has removable foot rests so my father can propel himself if he wants, and easily fits through the narrow doorways of our older home.",
