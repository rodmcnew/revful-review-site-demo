      "reviewText": "I was looking for a white set for my daughter's room and after searching on dozens of websites, I decided to buy this and try it out. I got it in white and love that is machines washable ( unlike others that I looked at) It is very soft and light, and seems to be well made. I also bought a ruffled bed skirt to make it even more feminine but not too busy. The shams have a beautiful trim on them, but the set just looks simple and very elegant. Great choice.",

      "reviewText": "Very glad that I made this purchase. This quilt is exactly what I was looking for. It's lightweight enough to use in the summer, but heavy enough to be comfortable in the winter. I was a little worried about the raw edges of the ruffles snagging, but I haven't had a problem with that, even after everyday use & washing it three times. Highly recommend!",
