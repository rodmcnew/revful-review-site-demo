      "reviewText": "I found them to run larger - or more fuller, to be exact - than I anticipated, based on the product photo. I don't care for a \"skin-tight\" fit, because we all know that just looks bad the larger up the size chart one goes (or, we *should* know it, but it seems some did not get the memo), but a close-fitting short can be flattering all the same - I ordered the size I normally do, found it to be roomier than I liked, and as the shorts stretched out during wear I could pull them down without unbuttoning... *That* can be awkward in certain settings... ;) /begin rant: Also - the photo doesn't show the back pocket, but the stitching is... to be indelicate.. something you see on cheap off-brand jeans, a desperate attempt to look 'hip' despite the plus-sizedness of the wearer. Sure, these capris are not expensive - some might say \"cheap\", but they're Jordache, and the rear pocket stitching is just *ugly*. Plain back pockets - is that too much to ask? /rant over",
