      "reviewText": "I would recommend getting this comforter set, even though when I got it one of cinches that makes the diamond pucker effect had come undone. If you don't stretch it you don't notice all that much, you would probably have to point it out to someone. It has awesome fabric, its warm, its got\na luxurious look to it that's not gaudy, and the color is really perfect. For 30 bucks its worth allthat, plus my boyfriend loves it too. A warning though, lol, when you order it....its going to arrive in a tiny box, don't freak out...its a magical illusion and it WILL puff out into something 5 times bigger. :)",

Not a \"true\" gray but, my accent color is purple so works perfect. Gives off an elegent look for hardly any money! I baby it so, it'll last me until I want to redo my room again (lol)",

      "reviewText": "First off, I was shocked when my comforter arrived just 2 days after I ordered it! That was some super fast shipping! :) I really like the comforter, I did think that the material was a silky kind by the looks of the pics online, but it isn't at all, just cotton like material, (which is fine#. I noticed that by the time I had it on the bed, my cat had already taken a liking to it and slept on it all day! So my cat definitely approves and loves to claw it! #the material has held up good so far!) I haven't washed it yet, so i'm kinda wondering how that's going to go....I ordered the gray color, and like everyone else said, it is NOT true to the gray color at all, it's actually more of a deep royal purple in my opinion, but thankfully since my decor is gray, the deep purple looks fine as well. Overall I think it's a great comforter for the price and as long as it holds up after washing, no complaints here!",

Also, I ordere the grey, and it looks purple. I even checked the package thinking they sent the wrong color, and it said grey. It just looks purple. Would not recommend.",
