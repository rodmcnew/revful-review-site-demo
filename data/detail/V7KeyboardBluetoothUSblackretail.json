      "reviewText": "This keyboard has excellent keypress feedback and can pair with my iPad, my Android phone, and even my Bluetooth-equipped laptop. It uses 2 AAA batteries, so it's much more convenient than having to recharge it - you can carry extra batteries and change them in an instant. Pairing was simple and quick and the keyboard is comfortable with good key spacing and all the functions you need. Highly recommended.",
