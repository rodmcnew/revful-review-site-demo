      "reviewText": "Great collection it's funny and action packed the complete series, you'll want to watch it more then once. If you missed any of the shows nows your chance, all are great actors. Well put together and fun to watch, you'll laugh and even feel the pain and injustice they all went through. There are 91 action packed shows all 5 seasons, you just get sucked in and want to watch the next show. Poor Chuck gets into so much troulble and Sarah and Casey are there to bail him out, they both tell him to stay in the car, not happening, he's got to be Chuck.",
