This watch is perfect: economic, light, and good looking. Time and date which are very important. If it is kind of big for your wrist, no problem, Walmart will adjust it to fit your wrist better free of cost at the jewerly counter. Battery is supposed to lat 10 years. And it looks very nice more expensive thatn wht it is.",
