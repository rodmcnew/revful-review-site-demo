Once I got home that evening I put it on, and I am telling you that this is one of the most comfortable pjs that I have ever worn. If you love super soft almost close to that \"wearing air\" feeling, then these pjs are fantastic for that. Those who don't like the discomfort of pjs that bind, then these are made for you. Just love 'em!",

      "reviewText": "I love these gowns! I've owned them in the past, but recently switched sizes and bought 3 new ones. They are super comfy. I love that the sleeves are capped...makes for more comfort in rolling over. They don't tug and pull at you like some gowns do. They are super soft. I will say that I usually wash and hang dry these just because it helps the fabric last longer. If you dry them, they still hold up fine (no holes or anything like that), but they lose that nice softness over time, so it's up to you.",
