      "reviewText": "My wife and I purchased the Nikon Action Extreme 12x50 binoculars, or \"bins\", (Product# 7246) for use in viewing wildlife at greater distances than our 8X birding bins can easily reach. The 12x50's offer a nice bright view, a very sharp image and they are ruggedly constructed. Our bins spend most of their time in the back seat of the car, so they tend to get bounced around a bit, hence we wanted durability in addition to high quality optics. In the field, these bins will experience wet weather and sudden temperature changes, so the waterproof seals and anti-fog nitrogen purged interior are also of benefit to us. The main reason we chose the Nikon brand was our extensive experience with other Nikon bins and numerous DSLR cameras. All of our Nikon optical equipment has consistently exceeded our expectations. Note that these 12X bins are not ideal for most birding. Birders are best off using wider angle 8X, of which Nikon offers a number of great models. It can be a little challenging to hold 12X bins still enough to avoid a shaky view, but with the right holding techniques and some practice it can be easily mastered. There are many more expensive bins than the Action Extreme series, but their BaK4 prisms, fully multicoated lenses and solid construction make them a great value.",
