This system gives me the ability to monitor what he is doing when I am in another part of the house plus we can talk to each other. The clarity of the screen is very good and the 4.3 monitor is very nice.",

After the monitor had fallen a few times it no longer workedâ€¦it was a white screen with no picture. For the price and its purpose, it should be made durable enough to take a few tumbles. I didn't even have it a week.",

      "reviewText": "I've had this monitor over a month and it works great. I expected to find an easy start guide in the box, but it wasn't necessary. I inserted the battery, plugged in the unit and the picture quality was crystal clear.\n\nI like to have the sound on and the video off when I'm napping. I like how the infrared lights are invisible, so it doesn't distract my daughter. It's great that it stores pictures and videos, which my old one didn't do. And I think it's a necessity to have a camera that can point, tilt, and zoom.\n\nThe only issues I have are that I wish it was a touch screen monitor, and I wish the video camera cord was longer so that I can raise it higher.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to my friends.",
