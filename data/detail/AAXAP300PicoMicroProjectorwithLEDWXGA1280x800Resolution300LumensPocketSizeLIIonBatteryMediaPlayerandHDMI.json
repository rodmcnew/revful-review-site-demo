      "reviewText": "--In a well-lit room, the p300 will still make a 32-40 image look good. Close the curtains so it's fairly dim (but still enough light to see and walk around) it can go well over 60+. In a dark room (or outside at night) I've been projecting on a brightwhite surface that's 12feet wide and 8feet tall..It looks fantastic! Any bigger than that (around 165inches diagonal) and its whites start to look a little too faded for my taste, though it's still plenty watchable. The colors are vibrant.\n\n--It has plug-ins for everything: HDMI, RCA, VGA/monitor, USB, MicroSD..And, very importantly, Audio Out (standard headphone-jack 3.5) so you can plug into a nice soundsystem for your new theater..or a little portable speaker cube. I've had it plugged into everything from a phone and computer to an old VHS and Nintendo64. It's versatile and its tripod lets you set it almost anywhere while you can play movies right from a USB/microSD memory device.\n\nYou can flip the image backwards/upsidedown/backward+upsidedown. This means you can use it with a rear-projection screen (or showercurtain) and you can ceiling-mount it as well. You can also use the keystone adjustment to help make sure everything looks square.\n\nCons (mostly the same with any small projector):\n--Its little fan has a bit of a high pitch whine, but it's quiet enough (like a computer fan) that you can't hear it through movie sounds/music.\n--The different inputs each have seperate brightness/color/contrast settings and you NEED the remote to change most of them..the color/contrast/etc that you set directly from the MAIN settings menu won't affect the HDMI/RCA/VGA/USB. So don't lose the remote!\n--There's no lense-cap, so be careful not to scratch the lense, and be careful/gentle if you clean it..I'd suggest compressed air rather than a wipe.\n\nGrab a sheet/posterboard/bifold cardboard/wall and a set of cheapo computer/ipod speakers and have movie or game night!",

We used both the a couple nights ago in our backyard and my grandson totally enjoyed the drive in experience. The projector worked flawlessly and projected a nice clear image on this very big screen.\n\nAt this point with limited usage I am very happy!",

      "reviewText": "Great little product for small training use. I love the concept that this projector was small light weight and portable. The price was good because it was still costly for the size.\n\nPro: Light, small, and easy to set up and great features for compact projector.\n\nCon: lack of brightness for presentation of large power point training. Not the best sharpness either and so, so projector tripod. Focus was average.\n\nI do not recommend this projector for business use in large group training/presentartion.",
