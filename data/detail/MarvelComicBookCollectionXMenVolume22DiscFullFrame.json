      "reviewText": "The Phoenix Saga was one of Marvel's best story arcs. It begins with Jean Grey receiving a dose of radiation from a solar flare which in turn triggers her psychic abilities to become the omnipotent Phoenix. Throughout this miniseries, other characters appear like the Emperor D'Ken, the Unstoppable Juggernaut, and Gladiator (by the way, there are no similarities between Gladiator and Superman!). Gladiator was one of the best characters in this series and I wish that they had shown him more often. Anyhow, I have no qualms about recommending this DVD.\n\nIn one of my other reviews pertaining to another volume of this set which featured a couple episodes of Mr. Sinister and the Nasty Boys, Marvel, for some reason, excluded Ramrod from the Nasty Boys. I think that was a very ignorant decision as this was a character of great interest.",
