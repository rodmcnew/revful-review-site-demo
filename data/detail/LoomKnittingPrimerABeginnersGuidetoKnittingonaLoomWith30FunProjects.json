      "reviewText": "This book is great for beginners, but it is also good for those with experience knitting on a loom. It goes beyond just the basics and includes instructions on how to do many decorative stiches such as cable, mock cable, double knit, rib knit, and others, all without needles. It shows you how to knit scarves, hats, socks, sweaters, and includes how to felt knitted objects. This is the book I've been looking for since I got my loom. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding on their knowledge of loom knitting.",
