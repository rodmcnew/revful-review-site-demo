      "reviewText": "I just wanted to provide some positive feedback on the 50g. This is one great calculator. Very powerful, tons of memory, love the RPN. Great upgrade from the 48G, which I have used for over 10 years as a chemical engineer. The enter button on the corner is not an issue to me that others have made it out to be.\n\nBought in on-line, and Walmart's delivery was early, arrived in great shape, and everything works great. Can not beat the price. Battery life is surprisingly good compared with what I've read on other forums.\n\nThanks HP and Walmart !",

      "reviewText": "After 15 years, I lost my HP 48. I was quite apprehensive about getting a new calculator. I use a calculator for more than balancing a checkbook so, of course, TI was out. After looking at the reviews/ recommendations there really was only one choice for a real scientific calculator - the 50G.\n\nThe 50G is quite a bit faster than the 48 for the features that I use, and it has an updated serial port to connect to USB.\n\nThe manual contained enough to get me started. Though the \"User Guide\" is freely available as a pdf, it would have been nice if they provided the it in hard-copy like they did with the 48.\n\nWhere some buttons moved and some menus changed, the 50G is a solid replacement to the 48. All is right with the world again.",

      "reviewText": "The HP 50G is a very fine calculator, but the manual is atrocious. I had to get online to find how to store and recall memory values and still don't like the way that feature works. I was spoiled with the well designed and extremely user-friendly HP41 line of calculators, so moving to the 50G is painful at best. The calculator certainly has a lot of features and of course the RPN is great, but the poor documentation on how to work the thing, coupled with the fact that some common features are just plain inconvenient (e.g. sto/rcl) really causes me to downgrade the calculator's overall rating.",

      "reviewText": "It was meant to be a back-up for the older but reliable and easy to use HP 41CX....yes after 20+ years it's still working...and well, but spilt some liquid on it the other day...so I needed a back-up plan.\n\nWish the owners manual was printed (but I can see that 880 pages is allot). While it's packed with features and powerful functions....sure would like it to have the simple \"store 01\" quick value save instead of odd sequence of key strokes to save....as numbers are stored often on the fly.\n\nHaven't gone past the first two chapters in the manual....so not all sure what it can do.",
