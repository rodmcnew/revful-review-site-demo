      "reviewText": "I have used Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for years and my closet is full of discarded ones. The problem is not with the keyboard itself, but the letters on the keyboard are not etched and after a few months the letters fade. I have purchased replacement stickers but after a few weeks they curl off and must be removed. I have now switched to the Logitech keyboard where the letters are etched and do not fade. I cannot understand why Microsoft (after all of the complaints on the Internet) still issues this keyboard with letters that fade because they are not etched on. My LAST Microsoft keyboard was a Microsoft 7000 and most of the letters have faded. Microsoft charges enough for these keyboards but they become junk after a few months.",

      "reviewText": "I really would have liked to purchase a wireless model Microsoft 7000 keyboard and mouse combo but the price was a little out of range.\nThe 4000 is wonderful to use. It fits to the hands so nicely and comfortable to use. I like the new style of the number pad with the equal and parenthesis keys above it. If you are looking for a really nice ergonomic keyboard at a reasonable price this is the one to buy.",
