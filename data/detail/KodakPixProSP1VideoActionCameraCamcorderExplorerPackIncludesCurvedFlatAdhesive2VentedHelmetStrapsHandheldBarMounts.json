      "reviewText": "Seen the GoPro's and always wanted one to record my families crazy antics and me bringing down large trees( I run a tree service),instead I got the PixPro SP1 for my birthday and I can't put it down! The quality of the video is amazing,crisp and even fast cars can't make it blur. The pictures are awesome too(for something with out a flash and not designed for taking pictures), better than all of my cameras, very detailed. Sound isn't bad either. Let my nephew film out the window and it played back the car stereo like it was a CD(range is not super though but I didn't expect it to be). Feels durable in your hands(I felt confident enough to let my nephews play with it,and I dropped and no damage). Screen is helpful,buttons are responsive,lenses change easily(comes w/two),and it's water proof(haven't test that yet). Overall I love it,does everything I expected the GoPro to do(even though I never owned one) and it comes with a ton of attachments,everything I'll need to hook it up to my helmet. I would of gave it five stars but it could of come with better instructions(I still can't get the wifi to work),manual comes on a disc so you have to scroll a pdf,a paper hand book would be easier to study,but this would not stop me from buying it.",

      "reviewText": "I am very pleased with buying this camera. I put it on an ATV and went on a ride. The video came out great. The built in view finder is great. It was easy to figure out. Yes it may not quite be a go pro in ways but I am glad I bought this instead. With the accessories that came with it, the price and use of use makes this a great deal. I set up a go pro for a friend and in no way was that as easy as the sp1.",

Could not get the wifi to EVER connect so i took it back. sad that sony would overlook a simple wifi issue.\nbought this Kodak, set-up was simple, came with a decent accessory kit, wifi worked. the fact that you can watch and control the camera from your smart phone is crazy cool. then the second day the \"ok\" button began to turn the camera off when trying to turn the wifi on. called Kodak, they said to take it back or send to them for repair. took it back, ordered another one and love it! Simple, AMAZING picture! already dropped it a few times with no issues. OH YEAH, this is the ONLY action cam with any kind of view finder. HMMM, think about that. and its a tiny video screen! a little bigger and heavier than the other action cameras but its not fragile either!",

It takes great stills, awesome videos, has plenty of accessories, and from the moment you open the box you are able to enjoy it easily, with an easy layout and instructions. I've never had a GoPro, but have seen videos and pictures taken from one. If I were to compare them, I'd have to stay with the PixPro, since it has both better pictures and integrated speakers and mics, not a plastic cage which excludes sounds. If you're into adventure, watersports or any outdoor activity, GET IT!!!",
