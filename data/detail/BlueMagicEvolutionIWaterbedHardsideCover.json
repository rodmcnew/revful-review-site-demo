      "reviewText": "This waterbed cover is heavenly! I've had waterbeds in the past and used traditional covers. This is far superior. The bottom is also the liner and the quilted top zips on easily. Thick quilting is very comfortable and stays in place all night.\n\nFor installation my partner and I put the liner in the bed and taped it with electrical tape to hold the sides up while installing and filling the waterbed bladder. We then zipped on the top. Easy to do.\n\nPrice was half of that at the local mattress store.",

The single zipper -- one way open, one way shut -- was the only drawback.\nFollowed suggestion from another purchaser about taping cover's sides to frame and then laying in the water bladder. Worked great.",
