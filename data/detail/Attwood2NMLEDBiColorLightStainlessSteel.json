      "reviewText": "i picked one of these up from a local store and installed it on my small swamp boat that doesn't have a dedicated 12 volt power system. when i got it home i hooked up a 3 AAA battery pack out of an LED flashlight and it powered it as bright as a normal 12 volt incandescent bow light. once i hooked it up to a 12 volt marine battery, i was AMAZED how bright this little light is! the only part i didn't like, is the the shiny stainless steel top cover, i was hoping there was an all black version like the all white version, but i just spray painted the stainless steel top cover black, and now im a happy boater!",

      "reviewText": "Great replacement for an incandescent bow light. It uses almost no battery power so you can leave the lights on and not worry about it draining your battery while anchored at night. The top indicators show that the light is on right from the drivers seat and is EXTREMELY bright. Its sealed up great and wont rust/rot out like the regular bow lights. Much worth the price to not worry about bulbs burning out, battery usage, and no corrosion. Compared to other brands of LED bi-colored bow lights...ITS THE BEST.",
