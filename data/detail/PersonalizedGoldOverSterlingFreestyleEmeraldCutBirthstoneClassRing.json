      "reviewText": "I purchased this ring online a few weeks back & received it today, weeks before it was even estimated to be shipped out. When I first purchased this ring with the stone color I chose (October, Rose Zircon) on gold, I was unsure if the stone would even show up good on the gold. When I received this ring today & opened it I was surprised as to how well the stone color did show up on the gold. Very beautiful ring, engraving is somewhat a good size & you do have to look close to see what it says but overall wonderful ring & very beautiful. Highly recommend this ring to anyone.",

      "reviewText": "The ring is nice, however, the engraving is small. It takes some doing to read the writing. Not bad for the price since I know my daughter probably will not keep up with it for long. Did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a class ring that she will probably wear for a year or so.",
