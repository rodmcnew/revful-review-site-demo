      "reviewText": "Was looking for an alternative to paying Apple for their cords that are over priced. Came across these. I have used and bought a lot of PNY products over the years so I thought I would give them a try. I have owned them for a couple of weeks now. They seem to be well made. Heavy cord. Big end on them where they plug into the phone (easy to grip without yanking on the wire itself). And they are twice as long.... Friends want me to order more for them...",
