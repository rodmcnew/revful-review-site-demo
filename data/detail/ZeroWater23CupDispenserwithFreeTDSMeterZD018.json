      "reviewText": "This is a wonderful product. Switched from Brita to Zero and noticed a huge and better difference in taste. With Zero the water you drink has really no taste so it is easy to drink. This one I never take out of the fridge not even to fill it. It comes with an easy to open flip top lid so you can add water without even taking it out of the fridge. Plus it is really nice because it tells you how much stuff you have in the water without worrying about what date to change the filter. Have filled the pitcher at least 10 times now and the first glass is as great as the last one I drank.",

      "reviewText": "The facts:\n\nPaid 39.99 for the ZeroWater 23 cup dispenser.\n\nTap water reads 361 TDS\n\nAfter filtering with Zero Water it read 000.\n\nAfter two weeks (approximately 10 gallons) the ZeroWater filtered water tasted metallic, like chemicals and acidic.\n\nTested ZeroWater output and it was 009.\n\nAt $40 for this unit, it was able to produce 10 Gallons of drinkable water, which works out to be $4 per gallon.\n\nI emailed Zero Water customer service and have not had a response from them in over a week.\n\n---\nMy Opinion:\n\nThe short filter life makes the ZeroWater product cost prohibitive.\n\nI will not recommend this product to anyone.",

      "reviewText": "Nice looking and a good size, but poor design on the valve because it leaked all over the counter, floor, etc overnight. The real kick in the posterior is that Walmart doesn't refund the shipping charges even though they don't sell this item in the store so they make $$ every time they send one of these out.\nThe water testing unit is nice, but what a waste of time and money the purchase was.",

Used the enclosed meter to compare distilled water, tap water, frig filtered water and the water from Zerowater filter....\nCold Tap water in central Fla... 250 ppm, HOT tap water... 350ppm, Ice cold water from frig filter 220ppm, distilled water 0-ppm, and the water from Zerowater filter 0-ppm. Biggest surprises...\n1. hot tap has 100ppm more than cold, Frig filter dose essentially nothing and Zerowater filter is equal to distilled but doesn't taste stale like distilled. Time to filter the reservoir is only 15-20 min.",

I keep it on my counter and use it for cooking. The water tastes really good and you can tell when you need to change the filter because you can taste the difference.",
