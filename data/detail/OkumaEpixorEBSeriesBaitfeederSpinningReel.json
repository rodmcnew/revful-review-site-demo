      "reviewText": "Received the Okuma quickly, was the lowest price I could find on the net for the reel. It is made in China, but what can you say. Was the smoothest reel I have had, the 9 plus 1 bearings are evident in the characteristics of the reel. The baitfeeder function works as advertised. You could spend twice as much, but not receive more performance.",

      "reviewText": "This makes my second set of Okuma baitfeeder reels.\nI've owned a pair of the EB 30 reels for two years now; and they have been great.\nNo problems, always work, casts well, drag is good, baitfeeder works great.\nThats exactly what I want in a fishing reel.\nI purchased a pair of the EB 50 reels because I am building a bit larger combo for river catfish.\nThe 50 series is a good \"average\" size reel; I'm not looking to build a surf rod.\nI have absolutely no complaints with the Okuma EB series reels....that's why I bought two more.",
