      "reviewText": "we purchased our generator late last year and really got to experience the convience of one on febuary 2,ground hogs day,our power went off around 3 in the morning while our furnace was running which is what woke me up,the furnace had shut off and started about three times all of a sudden and I thought it had blown up, but then iy went clear off and within a short amount of time the generator kicked on and the furnace came back on with no problems,this is really nice to know that when your power goes off you don't have to worry about anything,the generator will come on and run anything in your house without having to go outside and drag out a portable generator fill it with gas if you have any at the needed time and plug in your extension cords,which does not run everything in the house.the convience of be able to get up in a power outage and flip on a light switch and have light really is great,which is a small thing in comparison to having heat and hot water but it's nice to be able to do.",

      "reviewText": "I had this unit professionally installed by McGee Electric and they did a terrific job mounting it on a cement pad. The unit blends wells with the landscape. I couple this unit with propane fuel via an underground 500 gallon tank. I was without power for 18 hours during hurricane Irene. The generator ran flawlessly with two A/C units running, doing laundry with washer and electric dryer, oil burner and submersible well pump all going. I did not have to lift a finger to start or stop the unit. While the neighbors were struggling with getting their portables out (\"used to be me\") and refueling them every 2 1/2 to 3 hours just to power their refrigerators; I enjoyed having the whole house with power and watching a movie later on. I have the maintenance plan setup for this unit with McGee Electric so this unit will be giving peace of mind for many years to come. Thank you Generac.",

      "reviewText": "Spent quite a bit of time researching which generator to purchase before deciding on the Guardian 22kw. Read tons of reviews on all products and even when there was an issue with the Generac it was always quickly resolved. Brings a lot of peace of mind just knowing it is there the next time a storm threatens a power outage.",
