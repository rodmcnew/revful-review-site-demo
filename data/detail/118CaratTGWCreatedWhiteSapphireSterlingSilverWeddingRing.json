      "reviewText": "This ring met my expectations and is reasonably priced enough that I can afford to buy another with some color this time! ~ I chose a Wal-Mart-based storehouse ring rather than one shipped from another company because I wanted a solid guarantee & I wanted it in a hurry; it shipped quickly, just as I expected. Site-to-Store pick up was a breeze as well. ~ I've worn this ring for 2 weeks now without removing it for dishes, showers, or light gardening and it's retaining it's shine and clarity so I will start taking better care of it now that it's passed the test. ~ It IS a little THICK, due to the stainless type sterling used to make the band but I suspected that so nothing upsetting, just something to know. I've noticed that most rings of this type and quality are made heavier and thicker from ANY company that I've dealt with. Overall I'm very pleased since I didn't want to spend much over $50-$100. I've lost expensive diamonds from settings in the past so I wanted something I could wear daily without any worry if I happen to lose or trash it. These Wal-Mart rings are very pretty and fit that purpose.",
