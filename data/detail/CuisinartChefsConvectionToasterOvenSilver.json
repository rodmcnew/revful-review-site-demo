      "reviewText": "Bought this oven as a replacement for a older Oster convection oven. What a difference! The Oster was noisy and inefficient convection oven from the start. This new Cuisine convection oven is quiet, bakes and makes food taste crispy remarkably well. The toast function is adequate, however I get better results from a smaller Cuisinart oven. I think it's the huge capacity of this oven that doesn't allow the toast to cook right, too much space for a small single piece of bread. Selector is great, digital controls are totally adjustable, and the interior light is a huge plus (something that I specifically was looking for when selecting this oven). Convection controls are dual stage. You can have it off, single fan for refrigerator cooled items or dual fans for frozen items. Baked pork chops come out crunchy, while remaining moist inside. I would definitely buy this oven again and recommend it to anyone. Best price on the Internet was at Walmart.com @ $194.97. Two thumbs up here!",

      "reviewText": "This oven is sleek looking, compact, easy to use, light enough I can lift it, easy to clean, well worth the money. My old one gave up and I am really glad I found one that exceeds my expectations. I have using convection cooking for about 15 years and wouldn't go back to regular for anything. After using the old one for so long, I automatically assumed that chicken thighs would take and hour plus to cook. Wrong! They were perfect at about 45 minutes. I used the included roasting pan as suggested. It is sturdy and enamel coated.\nThis oven is so quiet I have to get right up to it to hear the fan blowing. I wasn't aware the technology had progressed so much since I bought my first one. Also it is bigger inside than it looks like it would be. Counter space is at a premium in my kitchen so this is much appreciated.",
