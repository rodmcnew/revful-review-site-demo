      "reviewText": "Having read some of the comments and questions, I just wanted to clarify this is a carrier for ONE child up to 50 pounds. It assembles easily, the connection to the bike is simple to fit (just turn your bike upside down, loosen the wheel nut and put the connector on), it is easy to set up (5 minutes at most to get it out of the car and opened up, wheels on, connected to the bike). To be honest, it takes me longer to get the bike off the bike carrier than it does to set up this awesome trailer. BEST FEATURE - it has a bug screen (mesh) AND a rain screen (plastic) - so on a nice day you can have the plastic screen up and let some air in without rocks being able to fly up into your child's face. You can also fit a little cooler and diapers etc in the part behind the seat). My 3 year old daughter loves it! Very easy to tow, hardly know it is there, what more could you want!",

      "reviewText": "I was very happy with this product. It was super easy to put on my bike. All I needed was a wrentch to unscrew the nut on the bike.\nMy grandson loves to ride in his \"truck\" He calls it a truck for some reason. I was a bit worried about the lack of a seat in the carriage but a small pillow was all we needed to make it more comfortable for him. He is two and weighs about 30 pounds.\nThere was very little pull on the bike when starting out and the ride was very smooth. You can hardly tell you are pulling anything.\nI love it. We go riding at least three for four times a week!",

      "reviewText": "I was looking for a bike trailer to take my puppy on rides with me. I looked at a lot of types and decided on the InStep, child's single, Sync Bicycle Trailer. Great Quality, simple to assemble and fold down, Easy to connect to bike and pulls flawlessly. Best decision I could have made. The dog trailers are twice as much money an not that different in size. I removed the seat and attached a safety harness. He has more room and there's plenty of room to carry any extras you may need. So easy to attach to the bike and folds conveniently for travel. Love it and can't wait to enjoy the summer.",

Its easy to assemble, light weight with big rubber wheels makeing it easy to pull, too. We just love riding together!",

      "reviewText": "I gave 5 stars on this product because of the value, quality and I can not find anything to complain about on this equipment. This product was well thought out. I feel safer with the baby closer to the ground rather than in a chair mounted up high on the Bike so this type of device works better for me. I was worried the baby would not like being seat'd in the charriot but he loves it.",
