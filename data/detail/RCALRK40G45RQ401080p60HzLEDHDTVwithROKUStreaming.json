I found it super easy to set up; I was watching within minutes. I have gone back and forth with the color/picture settings trying to make up my mind which setting I like better, but that has been the extent of any efforts on my part thus far with getting this tv set up.",

      "reviewText": "First thing I must say is This is my first Flat screen tv. I am also a dedicated cord-cutter. Previously I was usingg an old fashioned crt tv with a roku set top box. This tv blows that out the water obviously. The tv was easy to set up and the picture is awesome. It took no time to access my roku account so I didnt have to manually readd all of my channels. The menu allows you to really fine tune the picture to your liking. If there is a drqawback its the speakers are in the back of the tv. I already rectified this because i purchased a soundbar. It also helps that i purchased a soundbar.\n\nI also like that I was able to connect a flash drive to the tv and watch videos directly from it. usually i just use my roku for that. Another thing was the large remote. its bulky but it does what you need it to. If you are in the market for a good tv and are wondering what the fuss is about roku and cord cutting, this is an economical way to take the plunge. The roku stick is pre installed. I am sure for contractual reasons they cant call it a roku tv, But this is as much a roku tv as the tcl and hisense products .",

Within an hour she was up and running. The picture is crystal clear. When I am ready for a new TV I will definitely purchase this same TV.",

The Roku streaming was easy to set up and the set works well. Only down side is the picture isn't the best but it works for our use. I would recommend it to a friend for the same use.",
