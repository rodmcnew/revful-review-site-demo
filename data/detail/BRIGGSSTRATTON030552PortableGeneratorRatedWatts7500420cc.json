      "reviewText": "I bought this generator during the Sandy outage on the East Coast (Northern NJ). It's now in a housing that I open for use, with a 240v. cable to a transfer switch to give me heat, refrigeration, and communications. Just last week, after making it through weeks of snow storms without any power loss, a substation failed on a cloudless, windless, but cold day, and I returned home to start dinner for my child to find no power. One pull, setting a couple circuits on the transfer switch, and dinner was cooking while my daughter used the computer. I run it every couple of weeks for 20-30 minutes, and keep it gassed with preservative, but it's given us a lot of piece of mind, never mind heat, light, and entertainment when the rest of the block is dark. Best emergency purchase I've made.",
