      "reviewText": "I bought this for my AMD FX8320 which was getting very high temps with the stock Cooler and Heatsink. It was idling at around 30C which isn't too bad but when gaming it would jump up past 70C-79C, after I installed this cooler, it instantly went down to idling around 20C but the biggest improvement was when gaming it now doesn't get past 45C. Everything is the exact same (Same CPU, Room Temp, Same Temp Monitor Program) so even if the sensors are off and those aren't the true temps, The temp difference is huge so I know the cooler is working very well.",

With win7 up and running Blue Iris video surveliance with 15 cams running 15 FPS, my vcore and cpu temps are 40c stable.\nthats impressive since Blue Iris is a thread and core intensive program, hence the use of the haswell unlocked multiplier cpu. Its not that huge like a noctua nh14 but keeps my cpu cool. it is 158mm tall so make sure it will fit, height wise, in your case. other than that, buy it and you won't be disappointed.",

      "reviewText": "I just recently purchased the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO Cooling Fan for my gaming rig. Although I knew the dimensions before I acquired said product, its size alone is a \"Wow factor\" in my mind not to mention it's of premium quality. I greatly recommend this product to anyone that is in the market for a quiet, efficient, and high grade aftermarket heat sink. ( But, Don't forget to check the dimensions of this product and compare it with your available space within your rig!;) With that said it's at a reasonable price point for a great quality piece of gaming hardware. As for myself I give it an overall 5/5 star rating.\nHappy Hunting!",
