      "reviewText": "I recently purchased this product for my home and I'm quite happy with it. It's a modern technology that's affordable and I like how it has the feature where it allows you to view the real time and recordings through your smartphone/tablet device. This makes it convenient for me when I'm on the go or whenever I'm on vacation and would like to view the security footage. It also has an awesome alert notifications to have it email the recordings to you! All you do is just download the application which was very user friendly. I like products that are self explanatory and easy to use. This product is just that. Highly recommended!",

      "reviewText": "The video is poor quality and the motion sensor range is only about 20 feet. One of the cameras stopped working in less than 8 months since they are only weather resistant, not weatherproof. Customer service gave me the runaway because I purchased this on ebay, yet it was brand new when I bought it. Avoid this product and go with something else.",

      "reviewText": "The biggest drawback of this system for my needs was that it only records one camera at a time, and the delay is too long to signal it to start motion sensor recording. Also it seemed to record an event sometimes (like a car coming up the driveway), then not record it at other times. I am returning it.\n\nWhen something passes from the field of view of one camera to another, because of the delay sometimes I got nothing. By the time the delay triggered the animal or person was out of the field of view of one camera, but because that camera was recording an empty screen the second camera didn't record until the first one had finished. That meant that sometimes the subject was gone from the second camera by the time it turned on as well. I got lots of empty recordings.",
