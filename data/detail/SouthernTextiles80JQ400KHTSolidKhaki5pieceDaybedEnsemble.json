      "reviewText": "Very happy with daybed ensemble. The color is really darker than in the picture, but true to it's description as khaki. The fabric is soft, the skirt manageable for adjustment to fit and cover the bottom hi-riser bed, although it does have to sit on the spring and be removed when you use the bed.",

      "reviewText": "My bedding set did arrive on time, but I was very diasppointed in the quality of the product after the first wash. The batting (stuffing) inside of the comforter did not hold up to being laundered, the stuffing rolled between the fabric causing the comforter to fit poorly on the matress, it also seemed to have shrunken although it was washed in cold water, on delicate cycle using avery mild detergent. There was also a bit of fadding after being washed.",
