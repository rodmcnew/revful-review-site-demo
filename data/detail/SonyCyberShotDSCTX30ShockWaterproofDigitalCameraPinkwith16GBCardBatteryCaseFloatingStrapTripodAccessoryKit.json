Luck if I can get more than 2 days of life and 30 shots out of one charge.\nExtremely dissatisfied.\nStrongly recommend to purchase another camera brand and save yourself the aggravation.",

We followed the directions to a tee, but after the use in water, it never worked again. Now I have the same camera (black) and used it (in the water) the sad n e time she did and mine still works. Haven't heard from anybody if they'll repair or replace. Buyer be ware.",
