      "reviewText": "I got this for my husband as a Christmas present. He has been wanting one for a while. After only reading the one product description saying that the sound was not very good and there was a buzzing noise, I was very hesitant to get this one I also seen that it is for an HP only monitor after I had ordered it and was a little afraid that it wouldn't work! After opening it this morning he quickly rushed to hook it up. We did find that on our Dell monitors it wouldn't fit right. The hooks had a little raised place that just wouldn't allow it to go in. We cut them down flat and poof! It worked! As far as the sound, we hear nothing but great crystal sound! No buzzing or bad quality! So overall I am very happy with this purchase! Very great buy for your money!",
