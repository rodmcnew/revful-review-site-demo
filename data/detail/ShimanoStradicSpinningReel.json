      "reviewText": "going to pick up a 2nd one. it is VERY smooth. Xship is awesome -gives great cranking power and the handle is very sturdy, not wobbly like the cheaper reels. only used it a couple times but it has performed flawlessly.\n\nI highly recommend this. yes, they are expensive, but they will last (just make sure you rinse them, and all reels, with fresh water if you use it in saltwater)\n\ntight lines.",
