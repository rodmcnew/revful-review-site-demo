      "reviewText": "I bought a few different kinds of Urgent RX before a long road trip and I was very thankful in the long run. Not only are they small and easy to store in the glove box but they taste good and work fast. I recently took a road trip and of course out in the middle of nowhere I get a really bad headache. There's nowhere to stop and it's late at night but that didn't matter because I was prepared! Thanks Urgent RX!",

UrgentRx Critical Care Aspirin to-go packets fit anywhere so you take them everywhere. They don't require water and are easy to take. Its a smart choice. I carry them in my car, purse, pocket and I just feel better knowing that by doing so I might help save my life or the life of a loved one, friend or stranger. Its just better to be prepared.",
