      "reviewText": "I am a dialysis patient where the TV's are mounted on the wall in front of each patient (about 20). Person speakers offer no protection from the audio of those around you. If they have hearing problems, they turn the volume way up. The headsets I had did not drown them out, often making listening to my personal music virtually impossible. These headphone totally (almost) block out outside noises. I have to take them off to clearly understand people standing beside me. Better headphones than I anticipated, especial for than price.",
