Even HP doesn't have a fix.",

It prints okay and is an okay printer for the price I paid, however, the photo quality and scan quality is not near as good as my old HP photosmart printer. It is a nice, basic printer but I would not recommend it for photo printing.",

Takes forever to start from plug in, but meant to never be unplugged only low power stand-by. = Power button that can be turned on remotely. Works for me.",

      "reviewText": "One of the better inkjet printers I've owned. I mail approximately 700 - 800 pieces per month. Holds more envelopes than most models, clean printing with adequate warning when ink(s) get low. Like most printers today, almost as cheap to throw away the printer and buy new one when ink runs out as this one has dropped in price to $109.\n\nNot recommended for photo printing.",
