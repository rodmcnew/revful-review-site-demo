      "reviewText": "I have struggled not only with falling asleep, but staying asleep through the night. This really did help with both; on my first dose, I fell asleep quickly (within 30 minutes, as the directions said), and only woke up twice over the next nine hours, which is a major success in my book. I feel that with continued use, I will be able to sleep soundly throughout the night without interruption. And the taste is fine, not bad at all!",
