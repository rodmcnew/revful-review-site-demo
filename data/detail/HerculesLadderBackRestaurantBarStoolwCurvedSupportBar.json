Delivered in 3 days, wrapped with no scratches. 4 screws (5 minutes) and it was ready, made for a business environment (will hold my 240 pound son-in-law).. Excellent buy.... Cost $49 was about 1/2 the price of most furniture stores... Even tried CraigLook or list as some call it and used prices were about the same as Wal-mart new prices...",

      "reviewText": "I ordered these stools for my son's new apartment after looking at many in the stores, some more expensive. They are for three college graduates living downtown Chicago. These came packaged better than any product I've ever ordered, completely protected from damage and scratches by the manufacturer. They are sturdy, comfortable and don't take up a lot of room. The only thing that would be better is a higher back for really tall people. They were so easy to put together and the picture is a perfect representation of the product.",

They came packaged extremely well (we bought 6 of them and it took an hour just to get them out of their packaging) and not a single one had a scratch, dent, etc. They are solid, sturdy, and comfortable and I wouldn't hesitate to buy more should the need arise.",

No scratches or dents-well packaged for shipping. Comfortable, and especially appreciative of the non-scratch bottoms of the legs that not only protect floor but also adjust individually to help with leveling the chair. We have an older home that did not have a level surface apparently. The ends of the legs screw in or out for leveling purposes. Very pleased with the look. Simple and attractive.",
