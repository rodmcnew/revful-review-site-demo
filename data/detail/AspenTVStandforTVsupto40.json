      "reviewText": "The description isn't right. The item is actually the Z-Line Escalante 40\" wide TV stand which can handle 50\" TVs. The model number is ZL23-40SU. You will not be disappointed in this stand. The materials are high quality and it's obvious right when you open the box. The instructions are very clear and each part is labeled so assembly is easy peezy. Along with my 46\" Samsung LED TV, they anchor my living room. I highly recommend this product.",

      "reviewText": "Since this stand is rated for 150 pounds, and is 44 inches wide it can handle larger flat screens if the base is under 44 inches. Its working great for a 55 inch Vizo with a 38 inch wide base that weighs in at 78 pounds. The screen is wider than the stand, but its still works great.\n\nAnd as stated, it really is a Z-Line Escalante 40\" wide TV stand which requires about 2 hours to assemble and at 87 pounds the box is fun to transport home, and fun to dispose of.",
