      "reviewText": "I love all of the notes on this, so it is no surprise that I love this. That said, I always get compliments when I wear this and people asking what I have on/perfume. It has an air of sophistication about it but is not one of those pretentious-type, snobbish-type smelling perfumes. Just a classic and very classy scent. Great I think for a woman in her 30's or above, but I am sure some younger women could and also do like this. To me it just has a slightly more 'grown up' feel/scent about it, but by no means an 'old lady' scent. I love fresh and clean-smelling fragrances, and this definitely fits the bill!! My only one tiny complaint is that it does not last all day. But the scent dries down and stays true to the scent you get when it is first sprayed. But I am happy to re-fresh during the day with an extra squirt or two, if needed. So glad Walmart carries this, this is almost half the price for this size as it is at other retail stores.",
