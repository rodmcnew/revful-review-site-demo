      "reviewText": "This movie was simply fantastic in my opinion. Why Lionsgate did not do a full release of the film to theaters is beyond me, but it is a great movie. It is so different from the other types of musicals we seen made into films. I will say though for people not into rock music and dont like blood and a bit of gore, then this is not really for you.",

      "reviewText": "Incredible, totally 'over the top' rock opera experience. Paul Sorvino and Sarah Brightman were fantastic as one would expect from their reputations and Alexa Vega made quite a splash. I gotta tell ya though, Anthony Stewart Head kicked butt and took names. Outstanding performance, Mr Head, bravo!\nThe only con I can think of is that now I have the song 'Zydrate Anatomy' stuck in my head, can't get rid of it!\nGood picture quality, a little soft, but I believe it looks exactly as the director intended. Plenty of extras and I love the 'sing alongs'.\nIf you're thinking of watching this on your computer, stop right now. Get yourself over to a friend's who has a big TV and nice sound system and crank it up. This movie NEEDS to be big and loud otherwise you simply have not seen it properly.",
