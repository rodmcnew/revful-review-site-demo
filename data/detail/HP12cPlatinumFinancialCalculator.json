      "reviewText": "The price on this classic financial calculator has come down dramatically since I was in school (I was too cheap to buy it back then!). I bought this platinum version as a gift for my brother and he loves it. He was able to use it right away with the cheat sheet of formulas and programming that are printed right on the back of the calculator, and the fact that this platinum version accepts both algabraic and Reverse Polish Notation. RPN is great, but it does take a little effort to learn (well worth the investment). He's up to speed on it now and getting lots of good use out of his 12c.",

      "reviewText": "I'm an appraiser and am therefore forced to use this ridiculously outdated calculator to run cash flows for classes/tests. Upgraded to the platinum to avoid the long pauses while the calculator has to think about running net present values (like the old model). That part is much improved.\n\nHowever, I have purchased two of these platinum models and both are cheaply made, buttons need to be pressed twice to register an entry, and its been very frustrating. I'm finally switching to something a little more modern like the 20b. Don't buy the platinum unless you can't handle the delays while the old model \"thinks\".",
