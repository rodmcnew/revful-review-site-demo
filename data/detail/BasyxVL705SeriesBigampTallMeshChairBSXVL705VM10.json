      "reviewText": "Buying a chair without trying it out is a very hit or miss proposition, but this chair exceeded all of my expectations. The seat is firm, yet comfortable enough to sit in all day long. The back is very supportive and the mesh keeps you cool. One of my concerns was the height, since I normally need a wide seat and taller chair than the normal office chair. This chair exceed all of my requirements.\n\nWalmart originally showed the delivery date a week after I ordered it, but to my surprise, it arrived the next day. Purchasing this chair has been a surprisingly good experience. It was also about $40 cheaper than I was able to find it anywhere else.",

      "reviewText": "I was sooooo reluctant when it came to purchasing a chair that I could not try at the store. But, lets face it folks........ it is a rarity to find a Big & Tall chair to try at any store. I tried Staples, Office Depot, and all the department stores in the area. I ordered this after much online review and absolutely love it. It is super comfortable, the correct height for me (I am 5'7 and the lowest setting is perfect for me). It was purchased and shipped to my house in less than a week. My hubby put it together with no complaints at all.\n\nI also love that it doesn't look huge. It is just about the same size as my husbands regular office chair. :)",

She fits very well into chair and feet actually touch the ground also. Only down side is that seat could be a little bit more comfortable its rather firm but that is her preference. Great price, just hoping it lasts. Seems to be sturdy though.",
