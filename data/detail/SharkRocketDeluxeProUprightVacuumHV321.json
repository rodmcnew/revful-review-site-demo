      "reviewText": "The vac works great I have the same vac without the headlights. I never had a problem with it has great suction and can turn on beater bar for cleaning carpets would recommend to buy one if you don't have one. Better than a cordless vac since cordless vacs don't hold a charge long enough and eventually die in a short period of time (very short lifespan on a cordless). With a cord you don't have to worry about it quitting and works forever. Another family member has one and just loves it too. It is very lightweight and love the swivel head and being bagless too. If you don't have one buy a Shark rocket!! You won't regret it!!",

      "reviewText": "I just got this vacuum. Hooked it up and vacuumed the whole house. It did a great job on my wool area rug - which is still shedding. I had to empty the container a few times while vacuuming my living room, dining area, kitchen and hallway, but I just hung a plastic shopping bag on my arm and kept on going. Worked fine. I think with more practice on hardwood floors I will get better; it did a pretty good job. Picked up little pieces of floor flotsam easily and thoroughly. I love how it turns with a twist of the wrist and how it is low so can get under most furniture - not low frame chairs, ie, 2 inches off the floor. So far so good. Four stars cause it's not PERFECT.",
