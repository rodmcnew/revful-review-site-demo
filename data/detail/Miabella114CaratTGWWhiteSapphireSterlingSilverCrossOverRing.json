      "reviewText": "This is my first jewelry purchase from Walmart. I wanted to buy a diamond that I saw on Walmart.com but it was sold out. When searching for another ring I found this white sapphire ring. I was wondering how it would look, would it look like a fake diamond, a sapphire or what? When I received my ring, I opened the box and to my surprise this wonderful looking ring was inside. I put it on immedately, boy was I smiling! This ring is absolutely beautiful, it LOOKS JUST LIKE DIAMONDS. I would definitely recommend this ring. I am looking at it right now and it is shiny, and sparkling in the light. The picture on the site does not do it any justice. I am sooo glad I decided to take a chance on this ring. Thanks sooooo much Walmart.com! OH P.S. I Ordered another white sapphire ring, it is a little larger. I am very excited. I will tell you about it a little later ;o).",

The picture doesn't do it justice at all. When my ring arrived it was packaged in a pretty box, when I opened it I was very impressed with the quality of the ring. It is an excellent value! I would recommend this ring to anyone.",
