      "reviewText": "I really liked this ring when i saw it, and even bought this as my wedding ring (my husband got the same ring in the mens size as well) the only thing about this ring is that the engraving on the inside is hard to read, you have to shine a light on the inside to even know that something is written there. But since no one see's the inside of the ring anyways..it didn't bother me too much..this really is a great buy!",

I also got the matching man's ring. With the inside \"I Swear 10-04-2009\", I absolutely love this ring and we are getting married in November 2011 can't wait, thanks Wal-Mart :)",

      "reviewText": "I admit I was a little skeptical mostly because of the price,we went to a couple different mall jewelers and for the same product they want from $179-$400! We have been married for 12 years and I wanted to get him a new ring, because the old one wich was gold was bent out of shape and I was afraid it was going to break. We decided to get both male and female rings so we matched SO\nWe got Both rings for 58.00 engraved and very nice, better than I expected. Get this one you will not be disapointed. They weren't supposed to arrive until december 4th, but got them on November 23..",

Its perfect! Its cute and adorable. The engravement looks amazing and it really is a great ring. Very sturdy and the stone doesn't look that fake. I recommend it to anyone!",
