      "reviewText": "I have been working out for a year using various routines for my legs. So I got the hex bar to add more variety. And I can tell you that it hits the quads like no other exercise! I thought I had been working my quads well. But my first rep with the hex bar told me otherwise! I am looking forward to training with this equipment more often. I recommend to anyone who is serious about training their legs.",

      "reviewText": "Very accurate most of the reviews that I read to purchase this Hex Bar. I have problems with my back so it helps a lot to be able to do Squats and Deadlifts and protecting my lower back. Still to early to say but up to the moment am very satisfied. I am not the person that is planning to do very heavy lifting so I don't worry if you can add several hundreds pounds. I train for health and average strengh and not to become a bull!!!!!! The paint is not very good but I don't care as it performs very well.\nI am very happy indeed!!!!!!",
