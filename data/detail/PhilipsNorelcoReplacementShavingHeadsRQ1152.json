      "reviewText": "When I first got the razor, RQ11, the instructions said to replace the head every year. Well, I made it about 10 months. The good news is that it was cheaper than an older razor replacement head, and it started cutting as well as it did when I first bought the razor. From what I've seen on the market, this is one of the more economical razors.",
