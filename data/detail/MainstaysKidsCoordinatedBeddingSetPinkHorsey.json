      "reviewText": "I love this set. It just delivered about 10 minutes ago. To me the colors are bit brighter in real life than this picture (which I prefer). The pillowcase and sheets are a bright raspberry color. They look light in the pic (in my opinion). It's so cute. The sham is adorable with the big horsey on it. The material isn't the dull, matte fabric used in most less expensive sets. The sheets almost feel like they have a touch of polyester or satin in them. A step up from the cheap sheets usually included in sets. For the price you get a comforter, flat sheet, fitted sheet, pillowcase and sham. Best value and cutest design I've seen. I ordered \"raspberry\" colored curtains from walmart.com to go with and they match great.",

I bought this for my 5year old and it makes her room look absolutely beautiful. Its so whimsical. &the sheets are a great quality. The picture doesn't do it justice. Must buy",

This is a very vibrantly colored set, brighter than picture. The feel of it is what surprised me, it's very soft and sheets are almost silky. Great quality!",
