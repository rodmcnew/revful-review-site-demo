It is sturdy, nice looking and is easy to roll about. We use it to transport items from a small kitchen area to a hospitality table in another room. I would recommend it to anyone who wants/need a nice-appearing, functional cart.",

This cart is perfect - narrow enough to go through all the doors and fit into small spaces. The heavy-duty casters are a prime feature of this cart. It is in use everyday!",

Didn't use middle shelf so I could load more onto bottom shelf. Yes, it's heavy to put together but very durable, and very easy to roll on vinyl and carpet. Not as heavy as a wood kitchen cart and not flimsy like cheaper model. Gives me more stability when walking than my walker. Love it!!!",

My only complaint is the the directions could be a little clearer, but after a couple of fits and starts I did get it together with out the use of even a rubber mallet!!",
