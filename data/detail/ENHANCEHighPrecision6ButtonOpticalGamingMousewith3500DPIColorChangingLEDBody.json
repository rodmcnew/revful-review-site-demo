      "reviewText": "I play Counter Strike: Global Offensive competitively. Recently used a Razer Naga, And Steel Series Sensei. This mouse can't really compare to the Naga, But a bit to the Sensei with the design.\n\nPros : Cool lights, Does the job. No mouse acceleration, And aim is on point.\n\nCons : Feels a bit lite on the front, And heavy on the back. So for that reason (the way i play) sometimes the the mouse skips. Also, The rotation wheel got squeaky, And loose within the 1st week.\n\nFor the price, The mouse is decent. Would it be my 1st recommendation? No.\nDepending on the persons price range, I might recommend this mouse.",
