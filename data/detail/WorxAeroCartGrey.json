      "reviewText": "When my wife heard \"Swiss Army knife\" of lawn carts, she immediately ordered this for Father's Day. Everything performs as advertised. I added an old topless cooler on the fold down dolly support to hold multiple long garden tools for transport. I built my own seat which doubles as a really low work bench. I find a new use weekly. It's sturdy & well made & I'll trade capacity for ease of use every time. Oh & with a little cleaning, a great party beverage cooler as well as a corn hole dolly.",
