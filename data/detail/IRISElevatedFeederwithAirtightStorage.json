      "reviewText": "I bought two elevated feeders, one in large and one in small. I have a lab and a small lab/dauchand mix. The sizes are perfect for both dogs. The large one stores about 20 lbs of food easily. With a scoop in each, it's easy to feed them. Our dog bowls were always being knocker over, spilling water everywhere. Now the floor is a lot cleaner!",

It has a seal, so the food stays nice & fresh & the container holds up to 47lbs of food. + my dog doesn't have to bend down to eat like he did on the other. It's the right height for him. If your looking for a dog feed, I would totally get this one :) :) My dog approves too ;)",

      "reviewText": "When I bought this I didn't realize the height but it does work for cats.\nI have a 11yr old boy and he had a few issues and I was scared he would be leaving me,\nbut this has helped a bit with a change in food to make him alot better. He and his little\nbrother who is a year old sit at this dish and eat their food. They are tall enough sitting to eat and sit at the same time. And they are sitting perfectly upright. Glad I bought it. Works for cats as well. And with the bowls I can move the extra one on the floor for my lil girl who is rather short.",
