      "reviewText": "I bought this because I was looking for a large slow cooker that I could use to prepare huge meals in. I have only used it one time so far but I love it. The only down side is that the outside gets very warm so you want to make sure you place it on a hard surface and keep anything away from it that might burn and the lid does not have a seal around it but it did not seem to lose any moisture or steam inside. I used it to make chicken and dumplings in and they turned out great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a large slow cooker and wants to pay a fair price for it.",
