      "reviewText": "I received this ring for Christmas and wore it for two days, when the stone fell out of the setting. I returned the ring and ordered another one. After waiting 5 weeks for the new ring, using site to store, I wore the 2nd ring for 1 week only to have the stone fall out again. I never bumped or caught it on anything it just flew across the kitchen when I shook my hand. The ring is pretty but very poor quality.",

      "reviewText": "I've had this ring for almost a year I got it as a late X-mas gift from my boyfriend. It has a chip in the gem and the gems lost its shine and original color (I've cleaned so its not just dirty) which makes me think its just colored glass and not lab made like I was told by the clerk. I have a strange body make up that my body absorbs the gold off gold plated jewelry lucky for their sake it not gold plated. it also bent about 3 months after i got it. I now wish I would have gone with one of the other two rings that was my other options. I still like my ring all in all but that just might be because of the sentimental value.",
