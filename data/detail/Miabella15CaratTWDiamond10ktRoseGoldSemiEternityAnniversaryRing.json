      "reviewText": "I bought this to use as a band for another ring I purchased . I was disappointed to see that the ring does not look the same as it does in the picture and video. The diamonds look smaller and are cloudy. The pink gold is nice and it does go with my other ring well. I had a feeling that it wouldn't be the best quality when I bought this item, so overall I am satisfied with my purchase.",
