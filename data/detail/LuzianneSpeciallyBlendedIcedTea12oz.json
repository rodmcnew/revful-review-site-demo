Finally I found it online at Walmart.\n\nThe only thing that disappointed me was I could only order 1, and it took forever to get it. However I did find it, at another local Walmart, where I can buy it myself instead of online.\n\nIt is an excellent tea.",

      "reviewText": "All the basic teas for making ice tea, taste just about the same to me. Some times ice tea can have a merky look to it and also some times a musky taste. I must say that I prefer Luzianne tea and Walmart brand tea's for ice tea over any other. In addition, I love that Luzianne tea does not waste paper wrapping their tea bags. I always remove the tea bags from the package and place in a jar. I think most people these days store their tea bags in a jar or canister. I do like the family size tea bags best because I make pitchers of tea, not cups.",
