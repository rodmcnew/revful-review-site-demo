      "reviewText": "The chairs are lightweight and would be ok for children and average size younger teens, but are too flimsy and short seated for adults of average American stature. So if you have several children the tent and 4 chair bundle would be great, but you might want to buy separate chairs in a larger size for the adults.\n\nI am keeping the tent but will be returning the chairs.",
