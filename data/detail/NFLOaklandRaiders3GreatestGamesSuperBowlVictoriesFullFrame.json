I have got the same games on Ebay and trade sites from just fans that had taped the game that had better quality and complete games.Oh they also exclude pregame , halftime and the post game so I guess the trophy presentation was not a big deal.What a rip and a half done put together set.......",

      "reviewText": "Great DVD's ! After 32 years, Super Bowl XI was fun to watch! My favorite Super Bowl was Super Bowl XV! A great copy of all 3 games! All 3 for a little more than $19.00 is awesome!! Warning to anyone under 40,TV was different in the late 70's,so Super Bowl XI looks a little washed out to you youngsters! But take it from me, it is a great copy!",
