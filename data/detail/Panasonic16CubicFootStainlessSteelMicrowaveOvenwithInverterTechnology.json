Which after looking that up, found out it is now trash. Only has a 1 year warranty so now we have to throw it away. No idea why it stopped working all of a sudden, no power surges or anything like that. Just all of a sudden POOF - it's done for.",

No regrets - it was what the reviews said it was.\nPowerful, efficient - expecially the Inverter Technology - great for thawing and heating froaen foods.\nDoes not occupy a lot of counter space.\nWalmart had the best price and has the site to store option for free delivery",

      "reviewText": "Purchased in August 2010. Loved it at first. Looked great. No major problems.\nFast forward 6 months to February 2011 .... it died.\nI sterilized some baby bottles, and after that it was dead and couldn't get it to turn on again.\nFor no apparent reason!\nWhat? My old Sharp microwave lasted 15 years! And this one just a mere 6 months?!?\n\nI lugged this thing all the way back to the Walmart store with a receipt in hand. Having passed the 90 return policy at Walmart, the customer service desk said that they couldn't do anything for me other than give me the 1-800 number to Panasonic so that I can call them and send it in to their repair center.\nNot happy with that option, I persisted and finally the manager allowed me to exchange it for another microwave (non-Panasonic!).\n\n5 stars for Walmart customer service, but 1 star for this piece of junk.\nAt $129+tax, I expect quality and longevity.\nThis microwave did not meet my expectations at all. Steer clear of this one.",

But so did alot of other microwaves.\nThe price was in our budget so we chose this one.\n\nIt worked wonderfully for 6 months then just died.\n\nIt would give me the h97 error code also.\n\nI would unplug it and have it work a couple of times and now it will not even display the error code.\n\nIf you like shopping for new microwaves this is the one to buy, you will be back on the web comparing them again in about 6 months.",
