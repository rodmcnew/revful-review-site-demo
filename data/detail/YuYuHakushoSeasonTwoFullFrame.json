      "reviewText": "This season set contains four dvds. They are literally the contain the exact same dvds that funimation released [2 disc set of Third Strike and Team of Four. The menu screen of these dvd's still has the titles of those two dvds on them (third strike and team of four)] a few months ago. They are in a thinpak box set (contains two seperate thinpaks and they contain episodes 29-56. This indicates that it contains most of the dark tournament saga (which is actually episodes 26-66).\nIf you're looking for some nonstop, fast paced, uncut action, then I highly suggest you pick this up. This is a very rare low price too, it's a steal ($19.86) so I would act now before the price rises. So get these season sets instead of the other 8 2-disc dvd's out there because it is literally half the price for the same exact product (minus the artwork for the set/dvd cases of course). As for editing, there is non. There is all the blood, language, and ....inuendos that YYH originally contained. This product gets a perfect score from me. It's absolutely terrific that we fans can now purchase YYH for such a low price yet still get a 100% high quality product.",
