      "reviewText": "I bought this dog house for my dog but my 4 outside cats decided to take it over. They love it!! It is just perfect for the 4 of them... We live in a verrryyy cold, high-wind location, and this dog-cat house stands up to the test. And... I was able to flip up the bottom half of the door so it would stay open for my skittish kitties who don't like to be enclosed. (It works perfectly in the intended way as well). Absolutely 100% pleased with this caring and well-thought out home for pets. Thank you for creating a product at last, for folks like us who live in a cold climate. BTW, customer service was great. I had a question about the heater and my email question was addressed immediately. Thank you. Definitely a thumbs-up.",

      "reviewText": "Love this dog house! I bought it for my two outdoor cats to keep them warm in the winter. It is just the right size for both of them to get in and cuddle up. The heater was suppose to come with the dog house but they sent me the dog house without the heater so I did have to contact Plumstruck about the mixup. They were very helpful and sent the heater within a few days. All in all this has been a great purchase and I would recommend it!",
