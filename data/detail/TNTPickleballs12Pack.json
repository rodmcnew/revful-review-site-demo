      "reviewText": "These are being used by a wide range of players in a community situation. They are not favored by more experienced players who feel the bounce is \"off\". For novice players, kids and practice balls they work fine. We have not had them in rotation long enough to determine how well they stand up. They do have a noticeable seam which may shorten their lifespan. For the price they are serving the purpose so far.",
