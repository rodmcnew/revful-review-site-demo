      "reviewText": "I purchased 4 tires to replace Michelin tires which had met their milage warranty. These tires were rated highly and have exceeded my expectations regarding comfort and traction in snow. We do a lot of interstate driving at high speed, with a lot of secondary road travel, the tires have felt firm and handled perfectly. I would recommend them for people, encountering snow and rain issues, looking for a great value.",

      "reviewText": "I bought a set of these excellent tires and had them replace the Goodyears on our Chrysler mini van four years ago. We then sold the van to our neighbor when we bought a Nissan Cube. The Cube's stock Toyo tires wore fast and were too thin to make it through this winter so we purchased another set of Tiger Paws after seeing the tread left on the tires my neighbor's mini van. I feel a positive effect and could tell a difference in the way the car handled immediately.\n\nThis tire is a durable all season performer of great value.",

Yes 2009+ Fit owners,there is an alternative size! Transforms your car from a \"rough rider\" hyper-sensitive steering car to a Refined(!) sports car! Handling is still there with all of its glory. Noise is (get this) DOWN by at least 40%!! Gas mileage is UP 1-2 MPG!! I don't believe I could be any happier,and with a 70,000 mile tread warranty to boot! How can you get any better deal at only(in my area) $93 a tire,?? Going to get a set for my wife's Accord next!",

      "reviewText": "I put these on my Honda Civic, that had 140,000 miles on it. After having the car ligned up, front and back, I put these tires on and what a difference. Probably one of the best investments I ever made, as far as tires are concerned. Price was right, free shipping, Walmart had them on the car in less than an hour, and at a nominal cost. Much better than my experience with SAMS, a less than stellar experience. Uniroyal is owned by Michelin, which should tell you something. I live in Wyoming, where we get a lot of different weather. I now have over 10000 miles on these tires, with very little wear, I have driven 125 mph around corners with these, on dry roads, they have good traction in snow, rain or dry pavement and a good ride to boot.",
