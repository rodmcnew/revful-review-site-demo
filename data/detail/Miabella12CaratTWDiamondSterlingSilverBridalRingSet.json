      "reviewText": "When this came in the mail I immediately was going to return it. The picture is extremely magnified. I actually laughed. I prefer smaller rings (not tiny) but if you have chunky fingers it can be hard to wear a real small ring. I had this in my car to retun and forgot to take some pics... which I am ever so greatful for from other reviewers. I had been on break at work, taking the pics, and decided to wear them the rest of the day to see how the sterling silver would hold up. My co-worker noticed them right away and complimented me on my rings. Then I got a couple more compliments that day. I then decided to wear them until my return time was up, to check out the wear. Well I just past my 30 days and have decided to keep them. They have grown on me. For the price you cant expect a lot but I was thinking that 1/2 carat t.w. would look a little bigger. The diamond clarity is not the best either. I don't see any flaws. The center stone is about 1/4 carat... my guess. They shine great in the sun and in good lighting. I did buy a cleaning cloth and clean them almost every night. This shines them very nice and the dirt, oxidation or whatever it is that comes off of them is kind of nasty. The sterling silver looks like white gold, no one knows the difference. They have not turned my hands any colors and I use hand sanitizer all day at work. I would recommend these rings if you are looking for something smaller and it is in your price range. I was worried about silver but for the $ that it saves... I can't even tell a difference. I would buy silver again. If I can add better pics later to my review I will.",

      "reviewText": "My husband and i were eyeing this ring for quite a while now and finally decided to go through with the purchase. We are trying to save some money, and im not really that big on jewelry so i didnt mind the silver at all. It actually looks A LOT better than my friends rings that are in gold. I haven't even had discoloration or anything. A friend of mine went to get her white gold ring cleaned yesterday and it almost looked YELLOW! She paid like 4times what i paid!\nMine is still shiny and bright. I love it and so happy about the cost. I am petite, i took a size 5 and the ring looks great on and fits perfectly!",

      "reviewText": "I was very surpised whern I received this ring. I liked it more than I thought I would. It is very dainty, which I like because I have small, slender fingers. The center stone is not the best quality. It is quite cloudy. Overall, for the price it is worth it. I have actually gotten many compliments on this ring. I would reccomend this item to my family and friends.",
