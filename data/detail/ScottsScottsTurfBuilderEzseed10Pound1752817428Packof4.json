Another bonus \"ez seed\" provided, for us, is the grass appears stronger, thicker and more resilent than other grass seed. Love, love this product!!! I only wish it was alittle less in price.....especially in these bad economic times.....would help to give people something lushous to look at while living super frugally. Great product, Scotts Company!!",

      "reviewText": "I strictly followed the instructions, making sure to loosen the soil well with a garden weasel (with rotating tines). I spread the EZ Seed as instructed, enough so that some ground was still visible, made sure that the area was kept moist, and made sure not to disturb the area.\nIt's been over 3 weeks now, and I've given up on expecting to get anything more than a few thin blades of grass.\nLast year, I seeded some areas with my own mixture of seed, starter fertilizer, and peat moss, and had much better success. I should have done the same this year, but only needed a few small areas to repair. Feeling that Scotts was a superior product with a well-known trusted name, I tried the EZ Seed. Sorry to say, it was a waste of time and money.",
