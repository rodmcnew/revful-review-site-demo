The chairs are very modern and look great in my apartment.\n\nThe chairs were super easy to put together since they come assembled! All you need to do is screw on the vinly seating. I had purchased a glass table from another store and these chairs compliment it very well.\n\nI have a feeling these chairs will last me for a long time, and for the price, you really can't beat this type of quality.",

I couldn't figure out how to screw the cushions onto the chair, so I just sat them on the frame and it still works out. They're sturdy and comfortable.",
