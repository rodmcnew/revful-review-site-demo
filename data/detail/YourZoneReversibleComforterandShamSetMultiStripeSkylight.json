It is super soft and bright. I teamed it up with the Hot pink eyelash plush pillows and the hot pink zone sheet sets and it looks amazing! I have washed the comforter sets and put them through the dryer and they still feel super soft and look great. The comforter is not too heavy, just right for CA weather. You will not be dissapointed with this comforter!",

Not only is it good looking and vibrant, but it is warm, soft and comfy. It goes perfectly with any room, and is a beautiful sight to wake up to. And the price isn't that bad, especially for the quality. Being a teenager myself I recommend this for any teenager that wants to perk up their room.",

I purchased this comforter for my (master) bedroom at the lake, it is fun, bright and looks so cheerful. I have a queen bed and have the \"full/queen\" size that fits it well. I was worried about the size and if it would cover a queen well...and it did although I do need to find a matching bed skirt, but it works with the stripes going horizontally or vertically.",
