      "reviewText": "Although this table arrived quickly and is a pretty good value, as well as being a sturdy table - there is a problem. The problem is not the fault of Walmart, but rather the manufacturer. It is not packaged that well. The cardboard surrounding the table was in poor condition. The legs and metal frame were wrapped pretty good, but the top of the table was only in a plastic bag within the outer cardboard box which was in poor condition. I was quite surprised that the table top was not bubble wrapped or somehow better protected within the box. Therefore, when all was said and done the side of the table had an imperfection in it, a nick. If using this for a sewing table, (which I am), it would snag the fabric. Luckily I was able to sand it down a bit, so now it's smooth and not too noticeable. The manufacturer needs to package this table better. Also the directions for assembly were very crumbled. Regardless, this is a great table which will serve my sewing needs quite well.",
