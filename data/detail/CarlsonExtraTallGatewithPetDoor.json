Since I have had this gate I don't find any more messes and the cat is happy too!! He can also escape from the dogs.\nI am so happy with this product, Thank you Walmart.",

I tried everything but they always managed to get over or around it, so I figured they couldn't get over this gate and we would be able to walk thru it, and it worked.\nMy cats can't get through it except one little cat that can fit through the bars but she is the only one, all the rest just sit there and look in. Thank goodness.",

      "reviewText": "Excellent quality and price. Two issues: \"Small\" door is almost 8\" wide x 10\" tall. Won't work for our original purpose as \"small\" pet door allows our large sized (35 lbs) dachshund right through. We bought it to keep her on one side with us and to let our 6 lb Yorkie come and go. We need a gate with a small door. I would not want to tangle with the \"cat\" that this door was sized for when they made the \"cat\" door.\n2nd issue - The unlatch and lifting process requires either a very big hand to reach across the latch to slide the lock, or, two normal hands to open as well as securely close the gate. Unless the locking step is taken when closing the gate, the gate is not secure and can be bumped open by a pet.\nWhile it is not a problem, be careful when installling this unit, the door opens ONE WAY so check the swing path before installing.\nOther than the size of the NOT small \"small\" door, I like this gate. Easy installation, easy to clean and the gate looks very nice. I may try to rig a header and weld it over the top of the pet door to make the opening LESS than 10 inches tall. If that's a cat door, I do not want to meet that cat!",

      "reviewText": "This gate is very durable...enough to withstand both of my dogs! My dogs are 65 lbs. and 40 lbs..they both have jumped up on the gate, but failed to knock it over, and the gate is tall enough so that they can't get over it..I haven't even screwed the braces to the wall yet..I might not have to. This is a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone!!",

      "reviewText": "We are owned by a large and powerful mastiff PUPPY. This gate fits OUR needs until he is out of his \"training\" stages. ONLY because he has been taught NOT to jump up on anyone or anything, for ANY reason. HOWEVER, if he did choose to jump on this gate, it would fall easily.\n\nThe gate was easy and quick to assemble and arrived quick with site to store option. The BOTTOM portion on the pressure mount is great. The problem is the TOP pressure points. because of the gap in this gate to allow a walk through. u can only put so much pressure to hold it secure before u loose the option to open and close the gate. i added a picture to give u an idea of what i mean.\n\nu could make this work if u decided on screw the mounts tighter or looser before and after u needed to walk through each time. but thats ridiculous.\n\nin summary, i would recommend this gate to those whose dogs would NOT jump on this gate or who have the patience in tightening the mounts with each use.",
