It is easy to put together. The only negative thing that I can think of is hauling it into the house. It is heavy!",

      "reviewText": "This table is worth every penny. We found it elsewhere on the internet for similar prices as WalMart, but with an additional $100 in shipping, which almost doubled the price of this table, so purchasing from WalMart made it the lowest price source. This table is from a high-quality manufacturer, and it looks gorgeous in our dark wood home-library. It is not like the cheap, mdf furniture you see everywhere...this is a heavy piece with bullnose edges and discreet rubber on the ends of the top (like you would see in a school library) to protect it from dings. Let me tell you, the cherry finish and dark metal legs and skirt look great, and especially for the price. We use this table as a computer and project table, and I could not be more pleased!!",

      "reviewText": "I've had one of these at my mother's house for about five years. She uses it for her computer table. The table still works like it did on day 1!\n\nThese are very heavy, high quality, sturdy tables. They look great and perform perfectly.\n\nI've stood on mine to change light bulbs and clean higher areas, with no problems. I weigh about 190 lbs.\n\nI've since bought two more. I use one to hold large, professional quality photo printers. Each one weighs roughly 75 lbs, and they shake and move a lot when printing. These tables don't even budge. I can put my coffee cup on the table, and just see a little vibration in the coffee. Yes, it's a very scientific test!\n\nBecause these tables are so stable, I bought another to use for product photography. The table top forms a \"lip\" around the edges of the frame, ad it's perfect for clamping lights in ay position I need. I can put anything I can lift on these tables and not even think about whether it can handle the weight.\n\nThe table surface is very durable. It cleans with any household cleaner. I use 409 if it really gets messy. Otherwise, I just use a damp sponge. Mine show no scratches - not even the first one that I've had for over 5 years.\n\nSetting this table up is very easy. You may need a second person to help turn the main table top upside down, and to lift the finished table into place, etc, but I did it myself in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe ONLY downside is that you might need help getting it into your house - the package is heavy!",
