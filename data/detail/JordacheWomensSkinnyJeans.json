      "reviewText": "I've purchased 4 pair of these jeans and will be ordering the Rose and Chino next. I'm 5'6 and 175lbs I purchased the size twelve and they all fit perfectly. They are fitted but not to the point that they will cut off the circulation... also They do loosen a bit after being worn for a while. They washed well and all but 1(the dark enzyme) held their color.These mid-rise fitted jeans have A department store look and feel , but at a fraction of the cost. You can wear them with a tee and sneaks or flats, or u can dress them up with a cute little blazer/jacket, a nice blouse and a pair of killer pumps. These are definitely my go to jeans!!!!!!!",

      "reviewText": "Really like the fit of these Jordache jeans. Material is a bit light weight but the camo colors are interesting. Realize camo doesn't suite everyone's taste, but I think it's very cool. Great with combat boots and extremely comfortable compared to other skinny jeans I own. Price couldn't be beat for under $18.00. What's not to like!!!",

      "reviewText": "I can honestly say these are the best jeans I have ever bought. I have always had a hard time finding a pair of jeans I really like as some fit awkwardly and some I always had to wear a belt with just because of the way they were made and I hate belts. The pant legs on these are perfect size, not super tight, not loose, just right. I have a bigger butt and they fit PERFECT and I don't have to wear a belt because they stay in place. The length is perfect too, as I am 5'5 and they fall right around my ankles. The material isn't scratchy, it's a very comfortable material. I don't mind wearing them all day, whereas some jeans, I'm dying to take off because they feel weird. So glad these are less than $20! So cheap for such a great pair of pants.",

I am skinny, 5\" 7\" tall and these are very comfortable. They fit as if tailor-made and dress up very nicely.",
