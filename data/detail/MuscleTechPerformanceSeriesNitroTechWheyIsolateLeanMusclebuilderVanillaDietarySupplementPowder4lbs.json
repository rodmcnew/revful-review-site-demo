      "reviewText": "As an endurance athlete, I am always looking to increase my protein intake so I would take this at least 2X day and I never got tired of the flavor. It mixed smooth in my shaker cup with no annoying lumps or grittiness.\nThe ingredients are all top of the line so I know that I'm getting more than just a plain protein boost. Highly recommended.",
