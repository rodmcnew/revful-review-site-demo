She has the stuffed animal and she loves playing the game, so she was thrilled to get the bedding set. It makes her room so happy. There is not a matching bed skirt but it is fine, as she already has others that match the bedding. I am really happy to have found the comforter and sheet set, it is too cute in the room and she really loves it.",
