      "reviewText": "Ive had the tv now for about 2 weeks. Thus far for the price its not a bad unit. The picture is pretty good and its a nice size, perfect for a bedroom or guest room, etc. Only complaints is that (like others) the sound quality is awful! Definitely wasnt expecting it to be so poor especially upgrading this tv from another unit that sounded better than this one. You can try to make some adjustments with the equalizer, etc but more than likely unless you have some sort of home surround sound hooked into it you're gonna have to turn it up high in hopes to hear anything. Also it only has 1 HDMI input which is kind of a bummer as alot of things require more than one but I was able to get an HDMI switch for a few bucks on Ebay that allows you to plug in 3 HDMI cables into the one TV input. Beyond this I really dont have any other complaints thus far and again for the price (Walmart was very cheap, cheapest from all the comparison shopping/bang for your buck) you really cant beat it but pros/cons.",

      "reviewText": "We bought this tv for the kids to stream videos and play the Wii. It's been great! (Be sure to have the Input setting on AV for gaming.) If you put it on the wall, be sure to hang it low enough so it is seen easily from whichever position will be used most, unless you use a tilting wall mount. We found out the hard way that if it's shoulder-high for an adult, it's difficult to see while sitting on the floor. The screen is dark. We will probably move it down at least 6 inches, which means plastering in the holes and repainting! ;0P Also, if you have it shipped to your home, be aware that it does not come in an outer box. It arrives just as if you had purchased it from the store and brought it home, with an address sticker on the top.",

      "reviewText": "We bought this to replace a computer monitor and it's doing a great job as one. The picture is sharp, clear and has great color. The tv functions were easy and straight forward in the set up. Took about 3 minutes to set up all the cables, channel settings, etc. The only reason I gave the tv four stars was because of the sound quality. It sounds like its in a tin can. We just threw some speakers from an old theater system(handy plugs in the back) and it fixed that problem. If you want a good priced tv I would recommend this model. Just get some speakers for good sound.",
