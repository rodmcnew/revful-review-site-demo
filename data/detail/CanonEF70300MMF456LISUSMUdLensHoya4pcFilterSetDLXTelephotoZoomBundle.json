      "reviewText": "I've used this lens for the past three years on 60D and a 5DIII bodies. The sharpness and operation are excellent and the stabilization is superb. I've shot sharp images at 300mm and 1/30 second! The lens works well for outdoor sports when on the 60D. This makes the lens an effective 112-480 zoom.",

      "reviewText": "Optically this lens lens is pretty good, certainly much better than the standard series 70-300, which is unusable at focal lengths over 200mm. Where this lens fails is that the focusing ring is placed where the zoom ring should be situated. Jammed in so close to the lens mount it is very difficult to use this lens with gloves, and most of my shooting takes place in temperatures that require them. I have lost more than a few shots because of this. An obvious amelioration to this poor design would have been simple- to equip the focus function switch with three positions- Manual focus only, Autofocus only, and both Manual & Autofocus live. The lens as it exists, with the manual focus function always live, really stinks. It is very easy to bump the focus ring and disturb the focus. Other photographers that have asked me about this lens have agreed fully after holding it. I do not recommend this lens.",

      "reviewText": "I tested this lens to see if it could replace my 100-400. I certainly like that it's lighter and smaller, and the optics quality is fantastic. The rotating zoom ring (vs push/pull) is more versatile (I think push/pull is fine for still photography but when I shoot video it's impossible.) I also agree with others who said Canon should include the tripod mount ring, but that's minor. The biggest problem for me is that unlike the 100-400, this lens wont' work with the Canon Extender EF 1.4X III and 2x III. I occasionally want to go out to 500+ (e.g when shooting sports or auto racing). This is really too bad. I don't understand why Canon would not make it work, possibly a size issue? If I could use the Extender I would make the replacement and give this lens 4.5 stars.",
