      "reviewText": "Walmart.com has this item for $75 less than Cabelas. The item is sturdy and comes in two parts. The lower part slides into the hitch and the upper part drops down over the lower part. The two are held together with a slide pin. Not a 100% sturdy (some rocking back and forth) but nothing that'll hinder its use. When the hoist arrived, I couldn't get the pin completely through the two parts but nothing that a drill bit and a few minutes of my time couldn't take care of quickly. The gear lock is sturdy but needed a small amount of grease to operate correctly. The cable is LONG and I have no doubt it'll meet/exceed the 450 lb. weight limit. The swivel feature is great for getting the animal in the back of a pickup if you're out there by yourself and are in need of extra lifting assistance. I live in New Mexico where Elk are King so I wouldn't recommend it for those large critters (Elk and Oryx) but for Deer (Mule and White-tail)/Antelope, Desert Big-horns and Javalina, it'll work great. All in all... I recommend this product and have no doubt it'll last for many years to come.",

      "reviewText": "I used it on my sons first Mule deer buck and it bowed down some not to bad but enough to make me a little concern on how long it would last, it says for 450 lbs and my sons Mule deer was around 250 lbs. But it worked really good. The only thing I would suggest is that they would use heavier gage steel, better support structure braces, and if it was a little taller or adjustable for higher heights.",

      "reviewText": "I love this product. Built very sturdy and performs as advertised. It appears that the company listened to previous reviews and made some modifications to correct the short falls reported earlier such as the pulleys not being beveled. They are now.\n\nMy only issue is with wal-mart sending this review with the item name in the header. This was to be a surprise gift, but no more. My son saw the e-mail title and knew right away what it was. This is not the first time Wal-Mart did this. Please stop mentioning the item in the header.",

      "reviewText": "Used for the first time last weekend. PROS - Will no doubt handle the 450 lb rating. Solid construction and good looking welds. CONS - Winch cable has frayed strands along the length of the cable you do not want to handle the cable without good leather gloves found that out the hard way. Winch is inferior quality, had to drive about a half mile to a cleaning station with a 80 lb hog along a ranch road. Winch lock engaged but while driving disengaged and the load hit the ground.\n\nOverall like the product but will replace the winch and cable.",
