      "reviewText": "I bought this bag 5yrs ago and used everyday. I went through 3 other bags prior to buying this one within the first 8 mos. of my first boy.\nIt's style and plain black color grew with him and we still use it. It has not fallen apart. The only thing that has started to tear is the shoulder pad and that was just this year.\nI am glad to see it back. It was not in stock last year when my second boy was born...I did find another style Jeep bag from Target but I love this one better because it has more room and sturdy zippers. I have bought this bag for friends as baby gifts and it is their bag of choice as well.\nYou will not be sorry about this purchase!!!",

      "reviewText": "This diaper bag was wonderful to have. It fit about 10 diapers, three pairs of pants, six onesies, three jackets, a snowsuit, a can of formula, a bottle, wipes, a changing pad, baby powder, baby shampoo, baby wash, baby oil, A&D ointment and a Safety 1st set that included tweezers, scissors, nose suckey, thermometer, brush, toothbrush, comb and a few other items. I found it held everything I needed for an outing with my child plus some!",

      "reviewText": "I just got this bag since I'll need something HUGE for 3 kids under the age of 2 to accomodate diapers and bottles for all of them and I've not found anything bigger! I didn't want to spend $90 on a diaper bag and although this isn't as \"cutesie\" as I'd like it to be, it seems very sturdy and durable so I know it will last-- plus, hubby can use it and not be embarassed. I love it!",

We have plenty of room for juniors clothes etc. It was worth waiting two weeks for it to come back in stock. EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.",
