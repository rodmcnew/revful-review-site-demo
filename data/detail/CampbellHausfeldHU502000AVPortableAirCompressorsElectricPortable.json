      "reviewText": "Runs all of my air tools without any issues. The manufacture does not recommend air cutting tools, but it runs an impact wrench, nailer and a spray gun without any issues. The parts all work well, but I would recommend a different coupler that the one included. They are inexpensive and you can upgrade to a brass coupler. I plan on using this compressor for years to come.",
