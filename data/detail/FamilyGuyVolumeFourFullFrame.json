      "reviewText": "This box set of family guy comes with 3 DVD disks, with some great family guy episodes on them! Once I started watching them I couldn't stop. If time wasn't a factor I would have watched all three DVD's of it in less than a day! Also, Family Guy is very funny! Parents, be aware though that this show can be a little \"strong\" for young ones.",

      "reviewText": "I absolutely love Family Guy! I have got every season except 5, 6, and 9. Im working on it though. I got them all at wal-mart and all of them work fine except theres 1 that always messes up in the same spot every time and i dont know why but it's pretty much at the end of the episode but all the other episodes work fine. Just that 1 almost at the end. I've cleaned it and looked at it and can't find anything wrong so it must have came that way because it has been that way since i first got it. Anyways theres 1 more dvd that i have that seems thicker than the other ones and it plays but i have to set my dvd player up at an angle and when i do that it works fine. It has been that way since i got it too, but besides that i love all of them so much! I watch them every night! I mean every night. I am waiting on season 3 that i ordered through wal-mart.com. It seeems to be taking longer than the last 2 times. I ordered it on Feb. 18th and it said it should be here by March 4. Today is March 2nd. Last time it said 7-14 days but didn't take near this long. Anyways, i love my Family Guy dvds. As soon as i get season 3 i will order another and soon enough i will have them all and then start collecting my other favorite show American Dad!",
