      "reviewText": "I learned a long time ago that every kitchen product should do more than one thing. (Fire extinguishers not included.) Also, any time you are going to make a costly purchase that needs to last, go for quality and the durability that is needed so another purchase is not needed. I am very pleased with my new Granite Ware 20-Quart Pressure Canner / Cooker / Steamer and I look forward to many years of use from this product. Granite Ware is a great maker of durable cookware and kitchen products.",
