Not thin and flimsy but not to heavy either.\nThey are definately true to size. Mine fit perfectly without a pull or tug anywhere.\nThey also wash wonderfully!!\n\nI can't say enough good about these and am about to order more .",

      "reviewText": "I really like the red leggings I purchased. However, I can't call them denim and they don't feel like jean material at all. But I really like all the other aspects of the pants. They are a deep red color (actually it looks like they are dark red mixed with black). They have an elastic waist with a flat front which is something I truly desire due to the number of abdominal surgeries I have had. They have pockets which is a big plus for me as I don't like carrying a purse for simple errands. They are also lightweight which makes them very comfortable to wear during the summer. Its nice having options other than black, blue, white and khaki to wear. The price was great. I just wished I had taken a chance and purchased an extra pair. I'm hoping they come out with other colors and maybe a heavier material for winter wear. I definitely would purchase them.",

      "reviewText": "These fit well on a apple shaped figure like mine. Comfortable. However I did not realize I was getting a pin stripe so watch for that. I have tried for a long time to find a pair of pull on, heavy denium, stretch pants with no pockets like I have worn in the past. Also ones that are heavy enough to stand up to repeated washing, heavy, not medium or light weight; tight weave material. I want tight weave denium so that cat and dog hair brushes right off of them. I had these for years but now I have not been able to find them. This pair was not it but I will keep trying and wear these pants when I leave the house, not indoors where dog and cat hair will stick to them. If weight and tightness of weave is not a concern for you, the style and comfort are great.",

      "reviewText": "I bought JMS jeans before in-store but this time decided to purchase on-line since I was looking for a dark jean color. They arrived quickly which was great but when I put them on they ran very large. I liked the jeans but my usual size was hanging on me. I took them back to the store which is also great and was going to order a size smaller but in a matter of 2 days all the colors I wanted were sold out. I find this happens alot with Walmart on-line so yes I would recommend the jeans they run big and are a thinner material which is nicer in warm weather if we get any soon.",
