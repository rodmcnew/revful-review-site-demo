      "reviewText": "I literally bought, installed, listened to, and returned every other car stereo at Best Buy before coming across this one. I'm a complete perfectionist where my car audio is concerned. I\nhave 2 amps(different), 1 sub box with 2-10in. subs(bridged), 2-6x9's. With the 2-preout setup on the deck, I want to run a RCA for the subs to the rear/sub preout and run 2-6x9's(amp'd) to the front preout. When I do this the 6x9's drown out the subs? So I fixed that by amping the 6 in. door speakers instead. I'm not quite sure why my sub is drown out when I want to amp up my 6x9's but if anyone has any idea's, please let me know.\nOther than that this is the best sounding car receiver out of the newest Pioneer, Kenwood, and Sony stereo's!!",
