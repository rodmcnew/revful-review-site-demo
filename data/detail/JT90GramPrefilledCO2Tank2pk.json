      "reviewText": "this is a great source of co2 if you dont have a paintball shop near you that will refill the large tanks. i personally use these on my jt outkast and jt tactical guns and for the outkast, it uses three and a half hoppers of paint (100-150 balls in each hopper) and for the tactical, it uses slightly more co2 per ball and so i get about 2 hoppers of paint out of one tank. so if your just going to play a few games and its hot outside(the colder the temp outside, the faster the co2 tends to run out) i would reccomend these.",

      "reviewText": "Been buying these for a while now, I use them to bulk fill my Crosman co2 air rifles. It's cheaper to buy them on line than going to store which also cost for gas for vehicle. It cost more than getting my 20 oz paint ball tanks filled but I have to drive 80 + miles so I guess buying these is a better value. I also transfer the contents into my paintball tanks so I dont have a bunch of 90 gram cylinders taking space up in my gun case. I usually buy 6 to 8 cylinders at a time so I'm always stocked up when I get ready to shoot any of my air rifles. Dont have any paint ball guns so I cant comment on anything for them. They work great for my desired purpose though.",

We live in a very rural part of the county and have animals like coyotes, wild hogs, deer, buzzards, etc. I'm an animal lover and don't want to shoot anything with a bullet, although I will if I have to. These paintball guns will be a great deterrent for problem animals as well as my daughter and her friends to play paintball games on our property. EASY to put together right out of the box. It comes with EVERYTHING you need to start right out of the box. Precise instructions are included. This was my first time using anything \"paintball\" oriented and if I can do it ANONE could! Have fun!\n\nFrank D.",
