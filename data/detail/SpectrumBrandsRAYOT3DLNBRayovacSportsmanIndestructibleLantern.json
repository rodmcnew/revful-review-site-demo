      "reviewText": "I am amazed with the brightness of this lantern. We used it when we went clam digging at the ocean and it was easy to carry and we had no fear that it would get wet and stop working. We use it at night when we take our dog out. But the biggest reason that we bought it is for power outages because we can use it to see and read and it will last for so long . Excellent value and I would recommend highly.",
