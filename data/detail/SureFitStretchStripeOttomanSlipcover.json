      "reviewText": "This cover totally hides the rips in my favorite foot stool. It gave it a second life. It's soft to the touch & has so far been easy to clean. It even feels good to bare feet!\n\nIt was easy to put on. It did have seams that I didn't notice at first, so I had to work it around a little until they were in the corners. I pick my stool up & move it twice a day, but the slip cover stays on! I do adjust the seams after every move, but that's more me being OCD then it is the slip cover moving. It barely moves at all.",

      "reviewText": "The slipcover fits my ottoman they way I hoped. My ottoman is 30x25. The slipcover has seams at the four corner areas so that it is put on correctly. The elasticity is around the entire bottom so when it is taken out of the package it tends to look roundish rather than rectangle. Those seams are the key to getting it to fit properly. My ottoman has the \"built-in\" pollow top. There is enough material so that I could tuck it under the pillow top a bit to retain the pillow top look and still cover the sides. The legs are 5 inches long so I could not have the slipcover completely cover the ottoman to the floor. The stripes lay as they should. I am surprised another reviewer said they are \"wavy\". The material is a good weight. It is not thin or see-through. I received the slipcover a week ago so I have not had a reason to wash it yet. We have a casual lifestyle so this item works very well. If someone wants a high-end product to fit in with their lifestyle, it would be better to spend the hundreds of dollar to have a professional make a slipcover to fit. I am so pleased with this product that I am buying 2 slipcovers in the same color and stripe to fit my wing-back chairs.",
