      "reviewText": "I've used this product for several years, and finally wore out my first one. The newer ones have material on the outside that helps you grip better, so when purchasing them I was a little leery. When I received them I couldn't have been happier. My old one was over 5 years old, a little larger and didn't have grips on it. I used to have to use another pot holder so that I could use both hands, but not with the new ones. They grip so well that a one-handed grab is all you need on most pans coming out of the oven. Another thing that's great is one glove fits either hand, so it doesn't matter if you're right or left handed. This is a great buy!",

      "reviewText": "I thoroughly enjoy using the Ove Glove in my daily cooking. I am amazed at the absolute insulating protection from the hot surfaces I handle from the oven or stovetop. Be careful when using with boiling substances as the steam goes right through and watch that other hand. I recommend a second Ove Glove when the cook gets really busy moving hot pots and platters around! I would like to see a \"2-for\" offer at a reduced price offer from the manufacturer to promote safe use of the product.",

Our daughter just moved into her first apartment, and we got a pair for her. It's all we use. I use them often when I'm BBQing, as well. I just wish they weren't so expensive. Even if they were sold in 2s for a discounted price.",
