But we fix it up eventually and it worked very well. The blue fabric is durable and looks good. I love this chair.",

      "reviewText": "After 3 months of owning the chair, the piston like device that allows the chair to be adjustable by going up and down is already failing. It will stay in the lowest position, but slowly creeps towards the lowest position if set anywhere above that. The footrest becomes loose after about 30 minutes of use and then starts sliding towards the lowest position.\n\nThe worst aspect about this chair is that there is not enough cushioning on the seat. Within 2 days the seat cushion became so uncomfortable that I went to my local Walmart store and bought a 4 pack of 1 inch seat cushion foam, stacked all 4 on top of each other, taped them together with packing tape and put that on top of the seat. The extra 4 inches of cushion made this chair bearable as a replacement to my last chair.\n\nI would not recommend this chair to anyone. Save your money and get a chair with reliability and lots more cushion, especially if you are going to be using it every day.\n\nI'm preparing the paperwork to return this chair today. There is no reason why the chair should be failing after only 3 months of continuous use.",

      "reviewText": "A great chair, but beware before you start assembling it.\n\nThe website description refers to \"two Seat-height ranges available by utilizing included gas cylinder height extenders - 26'' - 30.5''h or 22.5'' - 27''h. Because, as with so many instruction sheets these days, there are no actual words employed, what actually seems to be pictured is the use of both height extenders with no reference to the fact that you don't have to use both of them. I used them both and the chair was too high. I finally figured out...duh... that the shorter extender results in the shorter height range and the longer one results in the longer. But it took much banging apart of already wedged cylinders to realize this. I'm happy now. I wasn't then.",

      "reviewText": "Bought This Chair For The Modified Counter I Just Added To My Craft Room. 24\" Height Stationary Stools Just Didn't Work, They Were Too Short To Comfortably Work With The Computer Keyboard, Mouse, And Screen On The Countertop, Or Do Vinyl Cutting, Weeding, And Application Comfortably. Needed An Adjustable, Reasonably Comfortable And Wheeled Drafting Stool Without Busting My Budget. Few Retailers Locally Even Had Them In Stock, But Were Happy To Order One In, But All Were Double Or Triple Or More In Price Than This One And Similar In Quality Unless I Was Willing To Pay Much Much More... Not! Found This One Online, Read The Reviews, And Decided To Take The Chance. Free Shipping To My Home Was Great! It Arrived Exactly When Walmart Said It Would, Was Easy To Assemble, And Appearance Was Exactly As Expected. Only Complaints Were 1) The Hardware Packaging Inside The Box Had Broken Open So The Screws Were All Over Inside The Shipping Carton, But Fortunately They Were All There, And 2) A Couple Of The Screw Holes In The Underside Of The Seat Where The Bracket For The Back Attaches Were Slightly \"Off\" But I Was Able To Manipulate It Enough While Tightening The Screws To Make It Work/Line Up And So Far So Good.",
