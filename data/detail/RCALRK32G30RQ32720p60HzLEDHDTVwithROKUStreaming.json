      "reviewText": "I bought this TV to replace a 20 year old that we used for the kids to play the Wii and watch VCR tapes. as such, I wasn't looking for the best picture or the best sound, just a screen that would work. this one does that. And I was hoping the ROKU would give someone a chance to watch something when someone else was watching the other TV. I was hoping the ROKU streaming stick would be more than it is. the instructions you get with the TV show the Roku stick as a separate piece, and I was worried for a bit because the only separate pieces were the remote and the base. The Roku stick is built in, with a little plastic cage over it, like it is a wild animal or something. If I had been shopping for a TV for full time use, I probably would not have gotten the 720p model, but this one is fine for what we use it for.",
