      "reviewText": "I stumbled across this in my local store on accident because someone had stuck one down in a bunch of toddler cups. I've been looking at the Zing Anything bottles online but the price has me twitching, so when this rang up $5.88 I was really excited. I got a teal color which isn't shown on the website, and my first creation was strawberry & lemon and it's great! The only reason this doesn't get full marks is that I'm gonna have to hand wash it. It says it's top rack dishwasher safe, but it's too tall for my top rack.",
