My only complaint is not enough pockets, but inside is big enough to store stuff with your dog. My 89lb dog did not fit well along with my 53lb dog, not enough room. Two medium sized dogs would fit fine or one large dog.",

      "reviewText": "I needed a stroller that could fit my 55lb 10 year old English Bulldog who can't walk too well so she could be included when I take my other two bulldogs out for walks. This stroller fits her very comfortably. She can stand, sit and lie down if she wants too. It was very easy to set up and is very light to push around. Its very easy to get my bulldog in the stroller. There are also many windows for her to look out of, I think she loves how much attention she gets every time she is out for a walk!",
