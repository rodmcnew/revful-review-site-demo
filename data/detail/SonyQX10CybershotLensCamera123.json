      "reviewText": "The idea is fantastic! I love that I can attach a better lens and take unique photos. The disappointment came when I realized that I'm not able to use this lens as a replacement for my camera on my phone. For example, like not being able to use third party apps with the lens. Also, the app is very minimal and doesn't give you much option or control. I was expecting software similar to what I see on the Nex 7 camera I own. The lag time to connect the camera is frustrating as well. I have an iPhone5 and it doesn't just connect - there's a process. I have the QX10 but I'd rather take it back and get the QX100, but only if Sony fixes some of these issues and soon. Great idea, great camera just needs a lot of bugs worked out.",
