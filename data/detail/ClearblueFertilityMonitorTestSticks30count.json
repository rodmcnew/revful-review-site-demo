I have 20 sticks left over, but I am so glad that I don't have try anymore. Don't walk run, to get these with the fertility monitor, it is worth it when you're ready to have a baby.",

      "reviewText": "This system did wonders for our reproduction efforts! First, I had no idea that I'm on a 25 day cycle. What this means is that I was ovulating 3 days earlier than expected. Second, I'm 38-1/2 years old and don't have to years to spend \"waiting\". Actually, I expected it to take longer so we ended up getting prego earlier than planned! I highly recommend this system if you're trying to get pregnant. The price may SEEM high, but it took only us 2 months to get pregnant, not to mention the cost savings from a medical standpoint!",
