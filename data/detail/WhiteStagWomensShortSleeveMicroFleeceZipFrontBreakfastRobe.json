      "reviewText": "I love this robe!!! The lightweight fleece is velvety soft, the pink plaid is so pale, & feminine, the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect, but my favorite part is the zipper pull with an adorable heart cut out. Sooooo cute! I'm very happy with this robe, & find it to be more comfortable, & softer than higher priced fleece robes that sell for 4x the price from other stores. A+++++",
