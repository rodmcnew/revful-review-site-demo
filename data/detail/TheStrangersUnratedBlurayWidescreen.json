After buying the Blu-Ray, I can't watch it alone or with someone. The whole premise scares the shoe out of me. It seems too real and if you watch it alone, late at night, in the dark and hear a knock at your door, DO NOT ANSWER IT!\nI MEAN IT!!!!!!",

I like how the relationships were much different from the typical horror/suspense film. I'd recommend this to own, even if you've yet to see it!!!",
