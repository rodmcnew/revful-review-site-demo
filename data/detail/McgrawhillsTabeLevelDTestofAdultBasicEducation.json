      "reviewText": "I needed to take the math part of the Tabe test and the counselor recommended this book. honestly it is the best $11 I have spent. I was horrible at math, and now I can honestly say that I understand formulas and solve problems. my advise to anyone who has to take any level of the Tabe test is to study the level of the test you have to take. (do not study level D if you have to take level A) You have nothing to lose and I passed the test by reviewing the book. Read everything from beginning to end in the section you have to study, do not skim through the pages or skip, you will find yourself liking math like I did. :) also FYI, if you are not prepared do not take the test because otherwise you will have wait 12 weeks to retake it again unless your college offers tutoring then you may take it in 6 weeks. also ask your college the time limit because I had to do the first section of math 40 questions - 24 mins (no calculator) so practice!!!! the next part of the math is 50 questions - 50 mins, Reading is fair timing 50 questions - 50 mins and language Arts might be same I dont remember. Ask your college for time limits on the test because in the first section of math you have less than 1 min per question. Good luck :)",
