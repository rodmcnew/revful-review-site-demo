Prepare yourself for a comic-like distorted animation filled will rich color visualizations and extreme perspective view. The story line itself is out of this world, literally. Watch how one man races his custom TRANSAM against other insanely modified vehicles. This movie has more into it than just the race itself. Its the race of universe! ENJOY!!!",
