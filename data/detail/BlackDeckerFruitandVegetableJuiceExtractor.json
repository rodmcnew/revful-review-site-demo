      "reviewText": "I wanted a new juicer, tried two Juiceman models and juice yield wasn't impressive and pulp a little too damp. I saw this one at Walmart and I thought \"no way could a $30 juicer be great.\" I was wrong. It's more compact and I'm all for pulp-extraction but not if it's from an oversized container sitting on the back of it. If you're just making juice for one to a few people at once, you don't need it. Or just pause to simply empty the pulp out if you're making a large batch. This one has the right sized container and just rests within the body of the machine. It gets better: Because the feed chute ends very close to the cutting blade (a problem many juicer models need to correct) it doesn't waste chunks of produce. The pulp is drier than about 7 other juices I've owned or tried. I've been using it 1x/day for 2 months now. I still cannot believe this cheap juicer outperforms so many others. The only con is the feed chute is small so I'm cutting thicker parts of carrots in half, apples smaller, etc. No complaint as I'm usually just juicing for myself. Small sacrifice for a compact, quieter juicer. Other tip: clean the screen cold water gentle via a soft or baby toothbrush then store the brush inside the clean pulp extracttion cup if you want. Enjoy!",

      "reviewText": "When I was looking around for reviews I noticed that a lot of people had a problem with the small feed and not being able to juice leafy vegetables. I found that the small feed was handled by simply cutting the fruit into pieces, it didn't slow me down the juicing was quick. It does indeed juice green leafy produce I've been juicing mostly kale so I know it does kale very well. What I do is ball the kale up and make it more compact, I also make sure to do the kale first so that other produce can wash the rest of the kale juice out. Every thing that needs to be cleaned comes apart thus cleaning was no problem! I've been doing the reboot your life program and it has been amazing!",

      "reviewText": "I bought this juicer yesterday because my daughter does not like veggies. Initial set-up was super easy and the unit is pretty quiet compared to my blender. I juiced 8 micro carrots (snacking size) and 2 pink lady apples which yielded about 12 oz of juice. The left over pulp was fairly dry and can be used for recipes. The unit took all of 5 minutes to clean under warm running water. The only thing I would change about this unit is making a slightly larger chute. The JE2200B delivers the juice at a great price. Totally worth the money.",

      "reviewText": "You get what you pay for! This low cost juicer juices fruits and veggies okay enough, but remember that it is smaller and not as powerful as the more expensive ones. If you want to make a lot of juice at one time, then it will take you a lot more time. It only juices small quantities at a time. Apples, cucumbers and carrots juice well, but you have to cut them up into small chunks first so they will fit. It does not do large greens as easily, like kale. I felt there was a lot of waste juicing my greens. One tip I picked up from a magazine--use a plastic bag (like the one you put veggies in at the grocery store) to line the waste receptacle. It makes for quick and easy clean-up.",
