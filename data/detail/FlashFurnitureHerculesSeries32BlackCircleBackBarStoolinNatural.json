      "reviewText": "Like the review before me, I also had been searching for quite some time for a barstool that was tall enough for my tall 47 inch counters without breaking the bank. To spend over $600 for two stools was just way over priced for me. I never thought to check out walmart but so glad I did. I received these site to store very quick. They are perfect!! I didn't think they would be tall enough because I was supposed to get stools that were between 33-38 inches tall but they were tooooooo costly, so I decided to take a chance on these. They may not be tall enough for small children but they are suitable for ages 12 and up. They are lightweight but sturdy. Love em!!",

      "reviewText": "Company coming so needed 2 extra seatings at 43 1/2 inch high counters. I figured our grandsons would mostly be the ones using them. They were perfect for our 8 & 10 year olds to eat there or even the adults. I have other lower bar stools at the island that have the same natural color on part of the chair. The new ones coordinate beautifully. They arrived sooner than I expected and were so simple to put together. Used them immediately. Seats were easy to clean. The price was acceptable given all the pluses I mention here. This is what I mean by perfect!!",

We wanted to add more seating for when the family comes to visit, and we bought 4 of these bar stools because they were the tallest we could find... and the price was unbeatable. Easy to assemble (only had to screw seats onto frames), sturdy construction, and fits our needs just right. Design fits our decor perfectly with wood back and black seats and frames.",

      "reviewText": "These chairs are certainly commercial quality and we're confident they'll hold up to my three kids' abuse. The padded seats are very comfy. The assembly was easy breezy - we only needed to attache the padded seat to the already assembled frame. We needed to find \"extended seat height\" stools to accomodate our 42\" bar height. These are perfect with a 32\" seat height. I only wish they came in different wood stain choices (these only come in a blond / birch looking wood). We're probably going to paint the wood part to match our walls. But overall, you can't beat the quality and price. The Site to Store shipping was smooth, easy and FREE! Highly recommended.",
