We tested it out the other night just to make sure it was good enough. We had a great night sleep! It was actually more comfortable that our own mattress. Glad we can give our out of town guests a nice bed to sleep in when they visit.",

      "reviewText": "I have had a queen air mattress before and this one seemed to be just a bit narrower than one previous but not a huge issue. I marked down the appearance just a bit because there isn't a cover over the cord where you wind it up and tuck it into mattress so it hangs there, it really isn't seen if you have a blanket hanging down. A bit more expensive but thought the 2 year guarantee made up for that. The sheets does fit nicely-I tucked the top sheet under the bottom sheet at the end to keep it tucked in. Comfort is Aplus. No complaints there.",

      "reviewText": "I bought this Airbed because I had bought a Simmons Cheaper unit about 3 yrs ago Walmart No. 002222108 queen size Airbed it lasted over 2 yrs it was a great buy. It began to leak so I decide\nto buy the Comfort Suite Queen. When it arrive I followed all the instructions and added Air just\nbefore usage only used the Airbed 2 or 3 time a week. I received and installed unit on 08-12-2014\nI when away over the weekend for 4 days, When I arrived back the Airbed had lost so much Air\nit was almost totally deflated. I tried to add Air to pump it back up, But it would not hold the Air.\n\nI can not take it back to Walmart for a Complete Refund, there is a 14 days or something\npolicy on refund. The only option is to return it back to the MFG (Simmons) the Mfg Warranty\nis 2 years free of Air leakage. Do not buy this Airbed it is terrible!!!!\nI just wasted my Money. I will have to seek I a New Airbed Mfg.",

      "reviewText": "My daughter and I set up the air mattress one week ago when she arrived for a visit. Each night she has had to add air, but we considered this normal. Well, last night she had to add air on 4 occasions and that is NOT normal. We've inspected the mattress thoroughly looking for a tiny hole somewhere, but found nothing. We therefore assume the leak must be coming from a seam. We expect to pack it up in the a.m. and return it to our local Walmart. I chose a Simmons because I had always had good luck with their waterbed mattresses in the past - apparently I need to look at another brand in an air mattress.",
