It hits at my hips, it comes in slightly at my waist, the shoulders fit me well (has small shoulder pads that can be easily cut out) and the sleeves were fully lines. The jacket is knit, so it definitely has stretch, but it's ponte, so it holds a very nice shape. I would like to buy this in navy as well.",
