      "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVED the Vampire Academy series and I was so sad that it was ending. Then later I found out about Bloodlines and that it was a spin-off series and I got super excited. I was afraid it wasn't going to live up to the greatest of Vampire Academy but Bloodlines is just as great in it's own way. I also love that some of the characters from VA show up in Bloodlines. I'm in LOVE with this series can't wait for book 3!!!",
