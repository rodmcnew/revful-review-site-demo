      "reviewText": "I replaced the original with an \"OEM\" battery from Ebay seller. It lasted ONE WEEK before it was just as bad as the original (charge lasted only a couple hours and would say \"fully charged\" after 15 minutes on the charger). Clearly the \"OEM\" replacements have been sitting on the shelf since I got the phone....5 years ago!\n\nBatteries Plus wanted over $40 for a battery for my phone!!!!!\n\nFound the Lenmar battery at Walmart online for around $12 !\n\nCharged it when I got it......it lasted a FULL WEEK before needing charging! That is better than when the phone was new!\n\nI really hope it lasts! Time will tell....and I will update this review.",

      "reviewText": "I needed a new battery for an old cell phone that I still use as a camera because the old one held a charge for precisely one half of ten minutes. It fits my old phone, it holds a charge for days, it allows me to record video for as long as there is room on my SD card. It's exactly what you'd hope a new cell phone battery would be. Plus-- the price from walmart.com was $6 cheaper than any other source, and that includes the Lenmar website! I recommend.",
