I removed plastic, put my foot in, pulled the shoe strings and one of the eyelets tore all the way through. Should I expect more from a $16 shoe...No, but it would have been nice to have been able to wear them at least once.",

      "reviewText": "I remember in the 80's that O.P. was a big name brand in surf culture.Not as big as they used to be(like other brand names Walmart now sells)but hey,the prices are way cheaper then they were in the 80's.I bought these shoes for my son who likes skater style shoes because of their rounded toe and the bottom soles have very good traction.With these style shoes you can tie them once and keep taking them on and off without having to re-tie them like my son does.The price was only $16 so if they last 7 months like the last pair did,buying two pairs a year saves me a lot of money than buying higher priced name brand shoes.My son is an out doors kid so he puts them to good use.When they start looking dingy,I simply throw them in the washing machine and they look good as new afterwards.",

So, I ordered two pairs of them from Walmart.com. I was completely satisfied with my shopping experience and with the product. The uppers and soles seem sturdy, and they're great for knock-around use (although they're not formal enough for work... at least for me). My only qualm is that they come with laces that are way too long. But of course that's easily remedied. 5 stars.",
