      "reviewText": "These tiles are excellent with tow caveats:\n1) the tiles are not EXACTLY the same sizes. They are very close but the laying is not perfect. You must make small adjustments. OTOH, no one who has seen our installation has found a single error. Over-all, it looks great.\n2) DO NOT short-cut the installation in any way.\na) clean the concrete and fill ANY cracks.\nb) etch the concrete\nc) put a bonding agent on the concrete\nd) lay the tile being very careful to butt the edges tightly.\ne) seal the finished tiles.\n\nIf you do not short-cut any of the above steps, you will have an excellent result. Skipping any step and all bets are off.",
