      "reviewText": "The idea is good but not worth the $31. I would value it at more like $4-$5. The electrical battery connections are poorly designed. After fooling with it for more than an hour, I did get it to run for about15 seconds and the small motor sounded as if it were laboring. (too much load)\nThe product is NOT reliable for public use. It needs to go back to the bench and clean up the fit and finish of the electrical connections, motor and shaft alignment and reliability.",

Its not the fastest being that its battery operated but it took alot less time than the way I had been doing it. Wal Mart doesn't sell replacement filters so I hope they're available thru King Kooker.",

It was not powerfull enough to pull the oil thru the plastic tube. I would not recommend this item for anyone at any price. It was a waste of $26.00 plus tax",
