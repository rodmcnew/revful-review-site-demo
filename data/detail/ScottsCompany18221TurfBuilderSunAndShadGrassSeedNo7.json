      "reviewText": "My lawn took a beating with the high heat and lack of rain this past summer. I decided to dethatch and aerate this fall and overseed with\nScott'[s Turf Builder Sun and Shade seed and Scott's Starter Fertilizer. Five weeks later, my lawn is a thick, deep green and looks as good as any I have ever seen. I used to have a professional lawn service treating my lawn and when I called to terminate their services and told them I was going to try to do it myself, they told me since I couldn't get the commercial grade materials, I would not have success. Boy, were they ever wrong. My lawn never looked so good. I would match it against anyone's.",
