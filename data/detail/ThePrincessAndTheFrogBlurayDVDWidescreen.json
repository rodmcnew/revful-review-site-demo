      "reviewText": "Disney has finally returned to good classic 2-D animation with \"The Princess and the Frog.\" The heroine is spunky a-la Belle, Pocahontas, or Mulan. The hero is more than a pretty face. The villain is actually evil. Adults and children with both like this movie.\n\nThe combo pack is ideal for those who have or do not have a blu-ray player. There are actually decent special features on the DVD.",
