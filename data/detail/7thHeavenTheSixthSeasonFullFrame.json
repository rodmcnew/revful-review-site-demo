Oh sure there is tv to watch these shows on,when one feels like watching tv that is to say. When I don't,I pop in a dvd,such as these.\n\nOne word of warning: The discs no longer feature the cast,instead,they opted to list the season episodes on the disc,along with the original year of airing. The discs are silverish,on the side where the information is printed.",
