      "reviewText": "It is a SMtown concert featuring all of it's major artists(Excluding Exo) that is worth having in the collection. It offers a documentary of how the singers got to where they are and their feelings on being able to perform at Madison Square Garden. On top of having the documentary on it, you get the whole concert that is played at parts in the documentary. Amazing performances by every artist, you won't regret getting this dvd! If you love Kpop, this is a perfect dvd to have :)",
