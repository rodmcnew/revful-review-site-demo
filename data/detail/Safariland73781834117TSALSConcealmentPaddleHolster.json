      "reviewText": "I got this back in March (2014) and it is a great holster. LightÂ weight and has a smooth drew. I mostly wear it with my Glock 22 on the range when I have range detail. Sometimes I forget it is there. It is defiantly lighter then my 6378 holster. A few of my co-worked saw my holster and liked it a lot. My only complaint is that you cannot make the paddle in to a zero or neutral cant. Not a show stopped for me. I still like it a lot and hopefully I can purchase another one.",

      "reviewText": "I have been using this holster for a little more than a month. I have to say that I absolutely love everything about this holster. The SafariSeven is a great material and does not harm the weapon finish at all. It is the lightest weight holster I have ever used, and yet after several torture tests, looks like new. The contoured paddle, unlike other brands, matches a persons curves and does not dig in or cause unwanted pressure points. This is also the first holster I have used with the ALS system. For years I have used the SLS and love it, I like the ALS even better. (SLS is still great!) For a holster that fits tight to your body for concealment, and strong enough to take a beating, look no further.",
