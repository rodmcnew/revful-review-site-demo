      "reviewText": "I mounted these lights on my Harley Tour Glide's crash bar to temporarily replace the larger rectangular driving lights of which one got broken. To be honest, the larger rectangular lights are two and a half times larger, and put out more light intensity with the same bulbs for about 2/10 of a mile. I put these smaller lights on until such time that I could find a replacement for the one broken larger rectangular light. These smaller lights do illumninate all of the areas that the high beams fail to illuminate for about 1/10 of a mile on a dark backroad highway. There is also a magnifier lens on the bottom of the lenses that brighten up the area in front of the motorcycle for about 50 feet. Strangly enough, with the larger rectangular lights which projected a flat 20 degree angle beam, althought they projected out further, they had some dark unlit areas? These smaller lenses project an even cone shaped 30 degree angle beam and no dark areas. With the high beams and these lights, there is full coverage in front of the motorcycle and side of the road with no dark under lit areas, and about double the illumnination intensity of the high beams alone. It helps looking for deer at night about to run out in front of you! Considering that I only paid $19 for these lights, I consider them to be well worth the money. All things considered, I may not go back to the larger rectangular lights which were too blinding for oncoming drivers, plus these look more like motorcycle lights anyway and can double as daytime driving lights. The larger rectangular lights, looked like automotive lights on a motorcycle. The four star rating is for the quality not being up to par with the metal Harley Davidson auxiliary lights, but then Harley wants a hunderd bucks per light! Objectively, the Harley lights probably don't do any better on illumination than these plastic ones.",

      "reviewText": "I was disappointed with these lights. The kit was very complete and I had little trouble with the installation. However, the light beams are too diffused perhaps because of the oval shape of the reflectors. Instead of penetrating the gloom, the beams spread to the side. My low beams do a better job of lighting ahead than these do.",
