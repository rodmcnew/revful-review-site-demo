Not too big, and they last a long time. Going to keep a couple packs in my tackel box......and PARENTS..... My 2 year old thought they were NOT to warm to touch...and NO i didn't take her fishing that morning! Might help keep kids warm if you enjoy plaing in snow.",

They do a good job keeping them warm for about the 9-10 hours. Some seem to get a little hotter than others but they still do the job. The bulk box has 40 sets of hand warmers. Each warmer is approx. 2\" X 3\" in size.",
