I worked\nfor weeks trying to get them off.\nLast resort with nothing to use, I started to use a sos pad on it\nusing it in circular motions a bit at a time for a few days,\nFinally all the marks and burnt on marks are gone. And there were a lot of\nthem. This was cheaper then buying a new stove because I could not stand the looks\nof this one.",

      "reviewText": "Been using SOS brand for many years. Once in awhile I will try another brand but they never live up to SOS. They get the job done that's for sure. To keep them from getting 'rusty', I place them on top of an airy plastic scrubby pad and it works great. Still my favorite brand of steel wool soap pad out there. Highly recommend!",
