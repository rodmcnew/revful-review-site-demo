      "reviewText": "Other than a place to keep my \"cold brewed coffee syrup\" the fridge is a non-essential compared to this thermal hot pot! After many years of perfect service we finally had to replace our pot. We refused to consider anything other than another Panasonic since we had so much good use and reliability from the first one.\n\n5 Star rating all the way across except for one small thing. The picture of the thermal pot showed a small red ball floating on the water measurement column. After receiving our new pot I've come to find out that the pot doesn't come with that little red ball anymore, and I'm not quite sure why not. It would sure make it easier to see how much water is left from across the room.\n\nNevermind though. This pot should last another decade. And combining it with cold brewing my coffee and a cheap timer to start the pot heating before I set foot out of bed, it's ideal for a good cup of java, whether in the wee hours or the late hours of my day ! I'll keep it !",

      "reviewText": "I bought this thermopot about 6 months ago and I just love it. We are tea lovers and it is SO convenient to have hot water whenever you want a cup of tea! The light that blinks shows that the temperature is higher OR lower that the one you have chosen. It will stop blinkig as soon as it reaches the chosen temperature. Very easy to use-just add water and that's it. I like the night mode too.\nTht only thing I am not 100% happy is the color. I would prefer it to be white to match my other appliances. It looks white in the picture but in reality it is cream.",

Wish that it would automatically switch to keep warm but it will keep at a hotter temp without this feature. you can also re-boil if you need hotter. very nice product for work for hot cocoa, tea, noodle soup, thinning too strong coffee etc.",
