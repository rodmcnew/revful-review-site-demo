      "reviewText": "I received this within 2 days of ordering. I bought a new black bedroom suite and really didn't want to buy an expensive comforter set. I thought this would look perfect. I just loved the pink flowers on it. This looks exactly like it did in the picture. It is a thin comforter so it will be something good for the spring/summer season. This comes with shams but no bed skirt. I was a little disappointed with that but for the most part I am pleased with the purchase.",

Its by far the thinnest comforter I've ever had but well worth the money. Can t beat the price either.\nMight have a few stray threads but the colors are beautiful. Perfect for summer.",

      "reviewText": "The colors are vibrant and it looks beautiful laid out; however I ended up returning it. I bought it for my queen sized spare bed, it barely covered the edges of the mattress, so if you have an extra thick or pillow-top, this would not work. The material felt very flimsy, like it might rip with normal use and had very little fill, so would not provide any warmth at all. If you are only looking for appearance, this would be very nice, but I would not recommend it for regular use.",
