      "reviewText": "This unit works very well to clean hard surface floor and low pile carpet. Dust bin is full of debris on each cleaning cycle.\nIt has all the features of much higher price Infinuvo robotic vacuum cleaner models, like remote control and UV light.\nHowever, it does not have auto battery charging and schedule cleaning time features.\nBut, it is easy for me to recharge battery by plugging AC charger.\nI read some reviews, finding charging station to recharge does not work 100% even for Roomba model.\nI am happy with this low cost model as long as it does cleaning and vacuum job.",

      "reviewText": "Well 1st off I'll start by saying almost any upright vacuum will do a better job in a faster time, there's no question about that! Now with that being said for what it's worth it's a cool little vacuum that still does the job, it just takes longer due to less power and a pretty random cycle. Now I've read many reviews on here before I decided to make my final decision and purchase it, but I'm quite happy with my decision! Yes it can get stuck in certain places if you don't do a small prep first before starting it up especially if you're going to leave your home for a while but depending on your home and your anti get stuck prep work which for me isn't much work you can come home to a clean house with interesting patterns on your carpet if you use it on your carpet. Speaking of carpets many people say it's not good on them and technically they're right...when you compare it to most push vacuums or I guess if your carpet is really plush or shag lol, but it will get the job done and pickup the dirt...it'll just take a lot more time to do it but then again it's cordless and hands free so why should you care right. It's run time is roughly an hour and twenty mins, but I have a one bedroom apartment with a large bedroom and living room and it'll do the job in that time for both including the kitchen and bathroom before it needs to recharge (at least mine will)! And for the price (compared to the other robot vacuums) this one is great! The only complaint I have is that it usually needs to go over certain spots more than once or even twice before it picks it up (at least on carpet). All in all I'm quite content with this little robot. 8-)",
