      "reviewText": "I was really excited to get season five; so were my daughters! We waited a whole week and were at the mailbox everyday. Our favorite episode was the last one where the sisters were goddesses. It was funny and so sad at the same time. We all cried when Piper lost Leo and we are anxious to see when she gets him back. Not to mention, I am waiting for my daughters to be able to find out who Chris really is. We enjoyed watching the Charmed Ones saga unfold. We are hoping to be able to purchase season six, asap.",
