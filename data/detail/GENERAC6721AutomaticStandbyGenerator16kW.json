I feel quite confident now that we are all set if the power goes out--a nice feeling especially because I have small children!",

Fuel is natural gas which is ideal. Just had installed but have not needed yet so could not rate as excellent. Overall sturdy construction and test phase runs pretty quiet.",

      "reviewText": "Should have spent extra money and purchased a unit that would have taken care of my whole home. 14KW does take care of the important items and every Monday morning it turns on and runs for 15 minutes. We had a outage for over 3 hours and the unit kicked it and ran perfectly------that's when we found out that we should have went larger. Unit is outside our bedroom wall, so it is at times louder that at other times. Since we bought our unit, other people in our housing area have also bought Generac generators for their homes.",
