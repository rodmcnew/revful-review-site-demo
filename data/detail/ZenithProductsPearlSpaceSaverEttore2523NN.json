      "reviewText": "The good news is that I put this together myself very quickly-- it took me about 15 minutes total. HOWEVER, please note that this must be MOUNTED on the wall. I was unaware of this and discovered this small but important detail when I finished putting this together. This spacesaver in NOT sturdy on its own, and is quite flimsy. The last page of the instruction booklet states that you must mount the spacesaver to the wall, however the consumer must have the tools and screws necessary to do so! Unfortunately for me, I have tile on the walls in my bathroom, and mounting this on the wall is not an option. Wish I had known before I purchased this because I'm sure there are plenty of spacesavers that do not require wall mounting. Hope this helps someone.",

      "reviewText": "I have to admit I am the sterotypical female that isn't very handy when it comes to assembling products but I actually made out okay putting this thing together! Assembly didn't take me a very long time and the directions were good because it had diagrams. I do agree, it needs to be secured to the wall. The \"feet\" could be a little wider to make it a bit more sturdy but as long as you tighten all the screws secure it isn't half bad. Some may not like the \"metal\" look & it is a bit more abrasive in person than I was hoping for but only my own fault as I took the chance. All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase, the price, and the site to store service went smoothly as well.",

      "reviewText": "I was skeptical to purchase this item, because I thought it would be to flimsy. But I have no time to go shopping, it's the Holiday Season, etc...so I grabbed one on sale, online.\nI was still skeptical after we got it out of the box, it seemed so thin and lightweight. It didn't take hubby a whole lot of time to put together, once installed it fit in our SMALL bathroom perfectly, and it's sturdy enough if you attach it to the wall.\nThe only thing I recommend is something flat to put items on, because they don't sit well on the wire-type shelves, or use a cute basket.\nFor towels, washcloths, it's great.\nYou cannot beat the price of $17.00!\n\nI recommend this if you are on a budget.",
