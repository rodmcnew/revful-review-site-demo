      "reviewText": "This bag is advertised as \"move away from the bulky\" and promoted as an accessory for Compact Interchangeable camera Nex5. Do NOT purchase this bag unless you want a HUGE bag for your little compact camera. We received this item and very upset it was recommended for the compact camera. I'll keep it for my larger camera equipment because it is a nice bag and not worth steps to return. Uploading pics to give you a realistic image. It is perfect for large cameras with lots of pockets but doesn't make sense to be presented as an accessory for compact cameras. Hope Sony fixes that!",

If you added like another small pouch on the side or tweaked the sides a little it would of helped the look of this bag SOO much better.",

      "reviewText": "Can't speak for Schoenauer except to say he probably should have bought his battery at a local store carrying Sony products. Easier to return and get a new one. I purchase this battery at a Best Buys Store for $85.00 a month ago and I haven't been able to run it down yet. I have video taped two 1 hour soccer games and come home and watched both games on TV and downloaded them to the computer all with the same charge on the battery. I wish I could honestly tell you what to expect in the way of time with this battery. I do know that it will last at least 2 to 3 hours. That's longer than most of us will tape at any one time anyway.",
