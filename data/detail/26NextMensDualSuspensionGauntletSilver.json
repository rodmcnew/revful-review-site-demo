Iâ€™m not so sure about not having any predrilled holes for a water bottle holder or an air pump but I just use my water hydration pack to carry my stuff around my trek in the Las Vegas desert. - ELV",

      "reviewText": "My husband had to make several adjustments to the bike when he first got it. Walmart didn't do a real good job of putting it together - i.e., the seat spun sideways. In the reviews he read prior to purchase, they stated that it would have to be adjusted. It took a few days to get everything tweaked just right for him, but he really like it once the adjustments were made. Because he is on the heavy side, he is going to get a different seat, but other than that it seems to be a really good bike.",

      "reviewText": "I recently bought the Huffy Rock Creek 26\" Mountain Bike which is also made by DynaCraft and equipped with the Shimano gears. However, that model felt incredibly cheap and although it handled my 10 mile ride through some rough trails decently, it just wasn't quite the sturdy mountain bike I was looking for, so I took it back and exchanged it for this bike, which was in the cruiser section so I hadn't previously noticed it.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that there are no predrilled holes for water bottle holders and such, which isn't a deal breaker but a bit annoying. Second is that the seat is basically a rock. Needs to be upgraded or padded immediately. But when you get past that you get a sleek, smooth, and sturdy bicycle. The grips are a very nice pattern, and the gears switch very smoothly, satisfyingly true in their clicks. The pedals have a nice grip pattern on them and the suspension isn't too loose.\n\nAs I jumped on this bike and took it for a spin in the Walmart parking lot, I immediately noticed a huge quality difference between it and the Huffy I had previously bought. In fact, it reminded me much more of a Trek that a friend of mine owns. This bike seems like the perfect choice for anyone looking for a good quality bike on a budget. And it's nice on the eyes too, which is always a plus. Just please don't even try to ride on that terrible seat before you upgrade or pad it.",
