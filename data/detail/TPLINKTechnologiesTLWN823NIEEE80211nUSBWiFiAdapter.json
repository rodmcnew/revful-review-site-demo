      "reviewText": "The TP Link 300Mbps Mini Wireless N USB worked perfectly. I had an old computer I had in storage still running XP that did not have a network card and I wanted to do an upgrade for it. So I purchased the TP link and had no problems setting it up. It was very easy. I would suggest though that you follow the very simple instructions that come with it. I followed them to the letter and it only took a few minutes before I was connected to a wifi at my local library. I spent a couple of days doing all the updates I wanted to and had NO problems with the device. It's a great product for $16.41 at Walmart. I did a site to store pick-up and it arrived a day earlier then scheduled, which was also a very nice surprise.",

      "reviewText": "This adapter was very easy to install. I like that it's small so it doesn't stick out from the computer a lot. I used it on a second-hand desktop PC that I purchased from a business. The PC had only used Ethernet Internet before. This adapter was a simple, quick solution for changing it over to the Wi-Fi in my home.",

      "reviewText": "A really easy to use product. Directions were great. My upstairs computer is online; without running yards of crazy expensive cable all over the place. And even though I got the last one in stock in tis model; new model is $4 bucks cjeaper. Most items of this type were running about $60 so I saved a ton. And per the caption it functions as a range extender/virtual hotspot. It the first product to keep its promise in a long time. I can't say enough about how happy I am.",
