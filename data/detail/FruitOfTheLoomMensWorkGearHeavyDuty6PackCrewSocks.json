      "reviewText": "Have looked for years for a sock that:\no Can be worn with dress shoes but also heavy enough for tennis shoes / working outside\no DOESN'T LEAVE A TON OF LINT / BITS OF FABRIC under your foot! This was the hardest thing to find in an affordable sock!\no Doesn't have goofy gold or bright red thread stripe across the toes (sometimes you go to someone's house and take off your shoes, and I don't really want my socks advertising to others)\no Is all this, plus AFFORDABLE.\n\nStop your searching - I've done it for you. I have researched probably 40 different sock brands, and purchased / used about 12 trying to find the good socks. These are the good socks. After testing them out for about 1 month, they passed all tests and I purchased basically a lifetime supply of them: 42 pairs. I can use them for dress socks at work, or heavy socks when doing work around the house.\n\nI've thrown all other socks out to donation now. One type of sock in the house = never having to match socks up after the clothes dryer again. Ha - you laugh at me. Ha - I laugh back when you finally figure out how much stinking time you've wasted matching up your socks after washing them. Any two socks in my house are automatic matches now. HAHAHA. :-)\n\nBuy these. Buy often.",

      "reviewText": "i got these based on the rating, but they are very thin, heavy duty remains to be seen. I'll use them but continue to look for better work socks. At the same time the price is good if you are looking for a thinner and probably durable work sock. i simply prefer a thicker sock that gives a bit more cushion because i'm on a thin rubber mat or concrete standing up 10 hours a day.",

The socks were comfortable though a little tight due to my size 12 and buying the 6-12 package. I bought these socks for comfort, cost, and most of all it was made here in the USA.",
