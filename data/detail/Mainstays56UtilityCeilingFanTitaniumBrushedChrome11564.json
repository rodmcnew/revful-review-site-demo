      "reviewText": "I bought two of these for use in a 30x34 detached 3 bay garage. Overall they were a great addition with simple installation, excellent fit/finish, and of course the value. I would recommend them to anyone for use in a configuration such as I chose.\n\nIf you are looking for a whisper quite fan for use inside of your home then these are not for you. They do circulate a lot of air but are rather noisy when used on the high setting. For me this was not a problem being in a garage but I don't think I would chose them for a home installation.\n\nThe speed control boxes that are supplied are rather bulky and hideous so I chose to simply run them from a wall switch instead of using this option.",

I thought my ceiling was about to take flight.\nI bought 3, and luckily, they're going in my place of business that will have loud music, so hopefully the noise will be drowned out...or I'll just have to keep them turned down low.",

      "reviewText": "I recently mounted two in my garage. One had to be immediately returned because it was very \"wobbley\" (way out of balance). There is no balancing kit supplied, and they are generally not that well balanced and both make \"clicking\" noises if not perfectly rotating.\nThe unit is only supplied with a hard wired/wall mount multispeed switch. It is large and ugly so I opted for an after market remote control. The units ceiling canopy is too small in diameter to house the remote receiver so I had mount the receiver above the ceiling electrical box. It workes fine, but what a pain to wire it up.\nTrust me, the fans are noisy! They do move a ton of air which is great in my garage, but the noise of the blades cutting the air is too loud for me to consider using in the house.\nThey do look awesome in my Man Cave, but I think the overall quality is questionable.\nI purchased mine here in October 2011 for around $45.00 each and that was a good deal, but I do not feel they are worth the almost double $88.00 price tag of today.\nI visited here today to buy another one as a back up for the future if one were to die, but with the price doubled, forget it! Obviously as I were going to buy a back up that should tell you how I feel about the quality and reliability thus far. They are not worth $88.00 each.",
