      "reviewText": "Used this Roaster & Rack Christmas 2014 to cook the Prime Rib. The basting of the rib was easy, room to get to the juices. The best part though not happy to admit but the roaster & rack didn't get cleaned for a hole day. Didn't soak just used mild dish soap and they both cleaned up in under five minutes. Great product would give as a gift again. Gave one to my sister for Chirstmas and one for myself.",

      "reviewText": "I was looking for a pan that could go from the oven to the stove top to make a sauce/gravy from the pan drippings. This one WORKS in that regard. I have found that best results can be achieved when you monitor the amount of liquid in the pan as your meat is roasting. Add water to prevent the pan from drying out. Moist heat is better than dry heat, so that you do not really need a lid.",
