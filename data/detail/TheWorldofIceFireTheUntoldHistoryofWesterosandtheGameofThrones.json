      "reviewText": "This is a classy book. The cover is padded, and the texture gives it a hint of leather, or something more than typical slick covers. The illustrations in it are often from fandom, having each been chosen by the author because they epitomize the topic covered in a particular set of pages. The pages are not black type on white typical book pages. They are rich colors, with frequent illustrations enhancing the text. If you're a Games of Thrones fan, particularly of the books, you should love this volume that enhancing by filling in more of George Martin's world.\nThis was a gift for my 21 year old son. He was even more impressed with it than he thought he'd be from the literary and fan reviews and descriptions.\nI shopped around, and Wal-Mart had the cheapest price. I combined it with another item (that frankly I could've just shopped for at our local stores) to reach the threshold for free shipping. It was nice to have them delivered to the house instead of having to wait in lines, and then wait for them to find it in their back rooms, at the store pickup!!",
