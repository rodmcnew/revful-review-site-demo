      "reviewText": "I have a job working outside, and my hands get cold(even with ski gloves) when the temperature gets into the lower 30's. I bought these online, and I put them in my ski gloves. My hands stay much warmer now. These don't get quite as hot as the Hot Hands brand, but they do the job. They are also a more reasonable price as well. With this pack, I should have enough to last me until this spring.",
