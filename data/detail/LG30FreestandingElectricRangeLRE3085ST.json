The glass top is a bit tricky to keep looking perfect but not impossible!\n\nThe installer gave me a hint on the stainless finish. He recommended baby oil on a soft cloth and to go with the grain of the steel. It works perfectly once you get the technique down!\n\nOverall, very happy with the features and appearance!",

The smooth cook top is easy to clean and is smart looking! I wanted a double oven but decided to buy this range because of the size of the oven, it is huge! Bought a Convection Microwave by LG and the two work and look beautiful together.",
