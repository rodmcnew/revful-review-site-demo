(Keep in mind this was an opinion of a service advisor)\nI'm going to keep using this product, and oil changes are cheaper at the dealer when you take your own oil. :0)",

I have used Mobile 1 and Lubro Moly, after switching to Royal Purple I no longer have dry start knock after days of just sitting that was present while using the others. I love this oil.
