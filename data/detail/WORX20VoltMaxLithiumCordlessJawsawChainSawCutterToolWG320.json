      "reviewText": "I was hopeful but somewhat skeptical that the Jawsaw would perform as advertised. It's easy to use and works really well. I'm small, and can still use the Jawsaw for quite a while before it gets heavy. You can use it from many angles, and it's easy to use whether you're left-handed or right-handed.\n\nOne of the best purchases I've made in a long time.",

      "reviewText": "This works really great for me and I highly recommend this saw. Easy to use and SAFE. I am afraid of other chain saws but feel very comfortable using this. The 20 volt battery lasts a long time (never lost power even on days we used it a lot) - also easy to re-charge. I followed advise of others and didn't get the extension and am glad I read that tip",
