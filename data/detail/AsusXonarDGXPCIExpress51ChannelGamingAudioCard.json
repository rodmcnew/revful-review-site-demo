      "reviewText": "Ok, first, the headphone jack on the card is also the front channel jack (and auxiliary jack if I am not mistaken). So you need to hook up your front panel headphone jack to the cards on board output jack if you wish to use headphones and have front speakers hooked up at the same time.\n\nI also had some trouble getting the card to recognize I had plugged in my headphones. Third party drivers solved this problem after some tweaking.\n\nOther than that this is a great card, amp is good, plenty of customization options. Takes some work to get it to work right, not a good card for novices.",
