      "reviewText": "This is something I've been waiting for a long time. I'm 46 and have been a fan of wrestling since I was a kid. Like most kids back then, I thought all the matches were real. The most colorful wrestler back then to me was Rick Flair. There were others like Ricky Steamboat, Dusty Rhodes, The Funks, The Road Warriors, The Ultimate Warrior, even Hulk Hogan and a whole list of others. I thought Rick Flair was it. I liked his style, his interviews and especially his alliance with the 4 Horseman. As the years went on and Triple H and DMX came out, that was the next best thing that really kept me glued to wrestling. When the Rock first came out with that wrestling alliance (I can't remember their name) I didn't pay much attention to him. As Rocky Mavia, I thought he was the tipical loud mouth wrestler but when he started coming into his own as \"The Rock\" I started paying attention and was delightfully entertained. I became a hugh fan. He had the charisma, the poise and the talent to be one of his one-liners (The Great One). I bought his biography and was entertained and when he left wrestling for Hollywood for which I thought would be a short time, I was still thoroughly entertained. This is must see video for any Rock fan and if you're not after seeing this you will be.",
