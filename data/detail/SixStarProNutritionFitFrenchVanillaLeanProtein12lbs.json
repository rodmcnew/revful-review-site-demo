      "reviewText": "I was shocked to taste this protein powder after reading the great \"tasting\" reviews on it. It not only tastes disgusting with a medicine flavor, it doesn't mix well either. After 5 minutes of shaking in my blender bottle, there was still clumps in it. I even tried it in a smoothie with banana and strawberries and the horrible medicine taste is still very strong. I'm not a typical protein powder fan, but I can tolerate the EAS brand. This one is just disgusting!",
