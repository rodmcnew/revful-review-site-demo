      "reviewText": "I was moving and needed a mattress urgently, but I really did not want to pay more than 500 dollars for one! so this is how I decided on this matters, hope it helps!\n\nI First looked at the memory foam mattresses but when I read the reviews I quickly noticed many customers considered those mattresses to be very stiff or hard, and that they retained heat or something if you stayed in the same position too long... I live in Puerto Rico so I needed a mattress that would stay cool and not get hot.\n\nNext I looked at the slumber one mattresses and liked the overall appearance and that it seemed soft.. but many of the reviews said they collapsed after a couple of months... so it was definitely out.\n\nAfter a bit I saw this one, the wolf ortho ultra plush and read that it was designed for side sleepers (which I am!) so I took a bit of a gamble on this mattress and I must say its pretty great! it's not as plush as I expected.. I was kinda worried it would be like one of those european beds where you just kinda sink in.. lol but it's not... it's quite sturdy and after 7 months of sleeping on it every night I can certainly say it's a very comfortable mattress that will probably last for another couple of years, so I'm very happy with my purchase.",

By others I was convinced I needed to find one in-store and certainly not order one that comes in a box.\n\nI'm so glad I took the time to browse online. For years, I've had hand-me-down mattresses and the ever horrible \"Bunk bed\" mattresses. This is comfortable, decently priced, and in a box. It made moving it in SO simple and so much easier. Bed time never felt better!",
