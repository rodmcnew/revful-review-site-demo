      "reviewText": "The audio comes in great on any of the radio stations you set it at. The only problem that we've experienced so far is the latch that keeps the lid closed for the dvd isn't very durable. One of our two y.o.'s forced it open and now it's hard sometimes to keep it closed, b/c the latch doesn't retract back sometimes to keep the lid closed. Maybe a more durable spring should have been used. We have it mounted in a mini-van and is easily seen from the middle and back row seats. For the older kids, it comes with a nice remote with lots of options. As far as mounting it yourself, you need to be pretty good with electronics. We had it professionally mounted for $150. For the money, it's not a bad overhead dvd player.",
