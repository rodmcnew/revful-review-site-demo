      "reviewText": "Comes with plastic coping strips. Much heavier with more material than less expensive WM products. Expect this to last much longer. According to manufacturer, you can put either the textured or smooth side up-simply (CAREFULLY) trim the excess material around the seam. Used for 12' pool-plenty of overlap-required trimming over sides as well. So far, worth the extra money.",

      "reviewText": "I do not have one single complaint about this product. It arrived quickly (i paid the extra), it was easy to install and seems to be durable. I do recommend hitting the pump hole with a wet dry vac as filling the pool- it really helped to get the wrinkles out. Otherwise, we used clothes pins to hold it in place as it would have been tedious using the plastic strips while filling and constantly adjusting the liner. we applied the plastic strips afterwards.",

We ordered a second liner (not as pretty) from an online pool company and immediately we could tell the quality was much better.\n\nIt's a great price, but the quality was very poor.",
