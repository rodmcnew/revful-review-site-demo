      "reviewText": "This product is the best that I've purchased by far. I like it because it is lite (only 10 calories per serving as opposed to 110 calories for the regular mix.) Our neighborhood Wal*Marts stopped carrying it and I was excited when I found it available on their website a couple of days ago at a very reasonable price. I ordered it 2 days ago and just received it this afternoon. I will continue to order it online as long as it's available....definitely worth it!",

      "reviewText": "This is a great product. I use it because it has very little sugar which is a requirement for me. The only thing that would make it better is if the local stores carried it. They used to and all of the sudden switched to another brand that is not good. However the on-line order is quick, shipping is quick too but it's a tad bit more expensive than buying it in the store.",
