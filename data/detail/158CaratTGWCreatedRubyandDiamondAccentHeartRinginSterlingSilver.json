      "reviewText": "I ordered this ring for my 11 year old daughter and I am very pleased with it. For Christmas we purchased what was supposed to be a sterling silver ring elsewhere but in 2 days it had turned her finger green. So I returned it and decided to check out walmart because I wanted something nice, cheap & real sterling. I didn't want to spend a lot because as I said she is 11. When the ring came in site to store and I first saw it...I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. It's even prettier in person than the photo and my daughter loves it!!! No green finger either and she hasn't taken it off since it came in which is about 2 weeks now!!!",
