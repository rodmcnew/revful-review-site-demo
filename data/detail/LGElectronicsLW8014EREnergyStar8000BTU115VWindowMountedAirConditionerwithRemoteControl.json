      "reviewText": "The fan blew in my Frigidaire (that's nearly 10 years old) and bought this as a replacement. I didn't realize how noisy the Frigidaire unit was until I plugged this LG unit in. It's so quiet, you don't even hear when the compressor kicks in. I have it on the top floor of a townhouse...can get very hot up there, very quickly. It can drop the temperature 7 or 8 degrees in about 30-45 minutes. After this purchase, I say goodbye to Frigidaire forever and hello to LG. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!",

My house is no more than 800 sqft and it seems to cool the entire place! It's quiet and doesn't take long to cool the home, it has various settings including energy saving mode and a small remote that comes in handy.",

      "reviewText": "This little guy cools 800 sf of 3rd floor attic space with no problem. A couple of years ago I decided to use the unfinished attic area of my house for a man cave / photo studio. The area was gutted down to brick walls when the house was totally rehabbed in 2006. It does have drywall and insulation in the 9' ceiling, but no side walls or trim around the windows. It was 90 degrees today outside and a cool 70 degrees inside. The compressor is so quiet that I have to listen hard to tell if it is running. This air conditioner is absolutely worth the extra $20 over the competition. Based on its 700 watt consumption when cooling, I figure the electric cost is under $1 a day. You can't beat that. I might add that I have a central AC unit in the 3rd floor space, but last summer when I used it along with the regular house AC, my total electric bill topped $500 per month. I think that I can save $100 a month by using the window unit instead of the central AC in the attic.",

      "reviewText": "We purchased this unit after our other window air conditioner stopped running. We've always had good luck with LG products and decided to try this unit. The unit is a great buy for the price we paid and is very quiet when the air is running. Sometimes you don't even realize the window unit is on until you feel the breeze that its fan creates. Definitely cools down our bedroom (10 X 10) on the second floor near the attic. We are definitely pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to a friend.",

      "reviewText": "I have been very satisfied with the unit's cooling power.\nHowever, there is a design issue with the drain plug. In order to compensate for the \"lip\" and the plug at the back of the unit, the unit must tilt down quite a bit.\nAlthough my unit was slightly tilted, a large amount of water collected in the bottom causing condensation just inside the window.\nMy handyman worked on adjusting the support arm to tilt more but ended up drilling a hole in the bottom of the unit just below the drain to facilitate drainage.",
