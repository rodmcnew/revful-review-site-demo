      "reviewText": "When you Prefer figure flats for various games rather then what could be $100\"s of dollar for pewter or plastic figures, Or to fasten terrain features For games like Memoir 44, Or game released by Richard Borg. Or stand up figures you need to base.\n\nThis is some of the best stuff I have ever used. Even better then matte Board in my opinion easy to cut and easy to use in games. I recommend it to any and all gamers",
