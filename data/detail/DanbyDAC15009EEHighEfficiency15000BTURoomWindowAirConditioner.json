      "reviewText": "When I ordered this air conditioner I was a little worried at how I was going to install a 100lb+ AC unit in my window. Danby really put some thought into the product design and made it so that you did all of the mounting work with just the exterior housing of the AC unit and then slid the heavy interior into the housing on rails. Great design for install.\n\nIt is doing a great job of cooling our upstairs space and I would recommend this unit to anyone with a large space to cool. It also comes with a 2 year onsite parts and labor warranty, This is a great AC unit.",

      "reviewText": "We couldn't get the unit out of the frame so we had to install the whole heavy unit. I have a framed window so the brackets were too short but that would be the case for any normal brackets. I bought this one because it required the narrowest opening and we still couldn't put the sides on with my unique casements. But it is a great value for a 15K BTU AC!",
