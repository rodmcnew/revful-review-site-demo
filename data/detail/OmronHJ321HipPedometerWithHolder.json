      "reviewText": "I have my second pedometer now. The first one was lost. Apparently there is no way to secure the unit to your clothing. Nothing is included. So I improvised and failed to note that the holding clip is too small for a normal belt, and does not securely hold the unit if brushed by clothing. Surely a lanyard of some sort with a clip on it should be included with the purchase. Sort of a pricy lesson.\nOther then that the unit does seem to work fine. The instructions could be streamlined just a bit. The included ones are way to wordy.",

      "reviewText": "This is very simple to operate. Just read the manual for easy setup instructions and go. I don't know if the readings are accurate, but I see it as a day-by-day comparison of my activity. Just keep steps above 10000 per day for a person my age for reasonable activity. It measures calories, aerobic steps, step pitch, etc, and saves all for a running 7 day record. It resets numbers automatically daily. The only slight complaint I have is the units display is small for my aging eyes.",
