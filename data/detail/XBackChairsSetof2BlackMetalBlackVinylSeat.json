If the chair seats hold up ( THE FABRIC ) then they are excellent, only time will tell. I bought a total of six and so far very pleased. They are also very easy to put together. Four screws and you're done. ( to attach the seat ) The only improvement that I would recommend is to make the seat just a little bit wider. It is ok the way it is but wider would make it excellent. I do recommend the chairs the way they are.",
