Unit gets beaten on daily by auto repair shop\n\nAny bigger and you might need special wiring.\n\nGood for a larger outfit that has greater IT needs, without going crazy.",

      "reviewText": "This is my second one of these - they work as expected. With two identical units both having network management cards, I have configured them as redundant - one power supply from the servers goes to one SMT2200, and the other goes to the other one. PowerChute Network Shutdown will then delay shutting down the servers until it gets shutdown requests from both UPSs. This is only a few seconds of configuration to get a great redundant system - but NOTE that both UPSs need to be the same model, and the network management cards need the same firmware. This feature alone makes it worth choosing a Smart-UPS model that supports it.",
