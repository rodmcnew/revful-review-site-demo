      "reviewText": "In my humble opinion Sulky is the best temporary spray adhesive on the market.I have tried/used others but they tend to be overly sticky and difficult to handle. I use Sulky for all my embroidered items and have also used it when I sew to hold patterns to fabric rather than pins.",

      "reviewText": "I have tried several spray adhesives to use to hold stabilizers to fabric that I am doing machine embroidery on. This is by far the best product for that purpose - it holds without being really \"sticky\", it doesn't build up on the needle, and it doesn't leave the sticky residue around the back of the finished design that many other products do. It is more expensive than other similar products, but it is well worth it.",
