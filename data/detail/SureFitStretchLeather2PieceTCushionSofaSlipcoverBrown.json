      "reviewText": "Much better than I expected. This isn't my first slipcover, but it is by far the best. It was a little tricky to get it all tucked in especially since the back cushions on my couch are loose, but it fits like a glove. It stays where it needs to after you sit on it, which is impressive! It took me about an hour, all by myself, all together to get it tucked in just right. I definetly recommend this slipcover.",

      "reviewText": "This is the first slipcover I ever kept! I like slipcovers, but they never fit right. This one did! We have pets, and we foster for a dog rescue. Sometimes my foster dogs take their chewing habits out on my old leather couch. The couch is structurally great, but the leather is worn and torn (and chewed in some areas). Didn't want to buy a new leather couch, so I tried this slip cover. Makes it look like new again without the cost of a new upholstery job! Fits wonderfully. I still keep it the seats & arms covered because of the pets, but no one can tell it is a cover unless they are told! Makes my old worn out leather couch with holes in the leather look new again.\n\nPros: Fit is great! Looks wonderful! and the stretchability is a big plus!\nCons: *kinda pricey, BUT a heck of a lot better than buying a new couch or reupholstering one.\n** Could be a little thicker is my only concern. No matter, I would recommend this to my friends and family.",

I also have an in home daycare. 10 kids in my house most of the day,everyday. My couch is beige, not a kid friendly color.This cover was Simple to put on and I have barely had to re ajust it and its been on for a month now plus everthing just wipes right off. Prior to this I had a throw that needed ajusting about 15 times a day and had to be thrown in the wash daily. I took a chance on this and could not be happier. My daycare kids and parents all thought I got a new couch too! It prob does depend on your couch but it just so happens it fits like a glove and the material pops back into place so well. I do love it!",

I have had them on my sofa and love seat for two weeks and have not had to fix them once. My old slipcovers had to be fixed every morning and looked terrible once someone sat on them.\n\nI am thrilled with these covers. The fit perfectly and made the sofa and loveseat neat and looking like new! I really love the fact the seat cushions fit in their own cover. I can't say enough about how much I like them. They went beyond my expectations!",
