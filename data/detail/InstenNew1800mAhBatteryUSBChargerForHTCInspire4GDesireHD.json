      "reviewText": "I got it super fast and it included a 110 volt batter charger! ( minus the micro end usb cable... I had some extras...) I was given the HTC Inspire 4g and with the battery and new compartment cover I was able to make a hand held 4.3 inch screen android tablet I can use it as a phone too with a wifi connection and groovie IP android phone app and make free phone calls over the internet! The original battery was a 1000 mAh and doesn't have much life this is 1800 mAh and lasts longer. This is an excellent price and a pleasure to do business with.",

      "reviewText": "Online reviews said that an HTC Desire battery would work in the HTC Inspire.\nOrdered and installed the 1800 mA battery. It works GREAT! My original 1200 mA battery was four years old and would die after only 5-6 hours of standby, even with all apps turned off to save power. The new battery lasted almost four days on standby and gave the device a NEW LIFE. HTC says the Inspire is obsolete, but the 8MP camera takes good photos and the unit works as a mini-tablet via wifi (not using the phone function).",
