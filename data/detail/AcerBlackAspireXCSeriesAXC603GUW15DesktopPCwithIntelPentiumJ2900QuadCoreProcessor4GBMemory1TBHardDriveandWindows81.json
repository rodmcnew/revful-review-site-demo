I bought this one because I needed a new computer and I already had the monitor, but on a small budget, this is probably the best PC I have ever used.",

      "reviewText": "This is a somewhat pricey low-end quad core system, with 4GB RAM (single stick, 2 slots), 1TB HDD, integrated graphics, USB 3.0 and HDMI out. You can upgrade the RAM but that's about it and you MUST use DDR3L memory. It appears the CPU is glued to the board and there are no PCI-E slots so you cannot upgrade to a better GPU. It comes with that god-awful Windows 8.1 but you can install Windows 7. Should you wish to go this route be forewarned you MUST downgrade the BIOS first or it won't work - there are instructions online how to do this. All in all it's OK for simple tasks and light gaming but don't expect to do any upgrades except for the RAM.",
