These jeggings are well constructed and very stylish. I wasn't sure what I was going to end up with at this super low price, but that's why I was giving these a try. Success! My girlfriends thought they were jeans they are so comfy. I just ordered 2 more pair in different colors.\nBorn in '75, I love that the horse is embroidered on the back pocket =)",

When I wear button jeans or pants, I have a major muffin top that pushes out through my shirts! With these, this doesn't happen. They are so comfy and look like jeans or dress pants. I wear them to work and I'm a teacher! The price is so awesome!!!",
