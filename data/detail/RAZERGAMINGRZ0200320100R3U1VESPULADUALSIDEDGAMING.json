      "reviewText": "It's been awhile since Wal-Mart has had this gaming mousepad. I bought mine about a year ago and still use it everyday. It has a very smooth side and a more course, abrassive side, (which i prefer) to me seems faster. I used to play wow and now swtor with a razer naga molten edition mouse. The gel wrist pad is very comfortable, especially for long houred gaming sessions. This is a very large mousepad, about 1.5 times bigger than your average pad. Overall i have been very pleased with this purchase and will continue to use it daily for as long it lasts, which so far has been a year of abuse and its still in immaculate condition. 5 stars, and happy hunting!",

      "reviewText": "First of all I cannot stand the wrist rest, but I am not a person who likes having a wrist rest, but I wanted to try one again. So I'm saying it slips around pretty easily without the mat that has the wrist rest attached to it, I'm now using it with the wrist rest backwards, so it doesn't slip anymore.\n\nThe smooth side(speed) is the side I have been using, I have a logitech g700s wireless mouse and it is only about a year old. My mouse's feet must be worn down slightly or something because after about 2 weeks this mat is starting to get a very large number of minor scratches, you can only see them when looking closely but they are there. This worries me as I think the scratches are eventually going to distort the surface slightly, which ruins the whole point of buying a premium mousepad.\n\nI would like to add that if you did want a wrist rest mouse pad this one would probably be pretty nice as the wrist rest goes under the the hard mat so they stay together. And since this has two sides I suppose the scratching problem wouldn't be too bad since when one side gets all scratched up I can use the other side.",
