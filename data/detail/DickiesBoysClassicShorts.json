      "reviewText": "This is the 4th year of using Dickies pants for uniforms. Yes, they are stiff out of the package but they do relax after washing yet still retain their crisp appearance. My older son is rugged with clothes, but this is the only brand that is durable and have held up. They are still like new and will be great for my younger son. The knees are reinforced, not just lined like the others. The fabric is such that stains wash away, just not pen ink and indelible marker. The red Dickies tag doesn't seem to be a problem for standardized dress code. The shorts DO lack the adjustable waist, but a belt solves that problem. The seem to run a bit long , I'm not complaining, just an honest observation. I wish I could say that about clothing for myself. If you're looking for good value/quality and long lasting durability, these are the way to go!",

      "reviewText": "I got these shorts for my son's uniforms LAST YEAR... and they still look new.\n\nYes, I could tell you about the very useful clasp 'hidden' by a button (so much easiar for him to get on/off himself... he's 5)... and how when I got them they seemed like good quality - yes the material is sort of stiff when you get them out of the package (not as bad as cardboard, in my opinion... but very sturdy stuff), I could tell you how nice they look on him - but really, none of that impressed me nearly as much as my sons khaki-ish colored shorts lasting an ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR, and comming out 'new' looking.\n\nHe's five. He spills, he runs and plays, and none of his other clothes 'made it' through the year... but I didn't even need to get him new shorts for this year (adjustable waistband!), which makes them an even BETTER bargin than I originally thought (and I was impressed when I got them).\n\nThis year I DID get the similar dickie's pants from on here -- we'll see if they do as well as these shorts did.",
