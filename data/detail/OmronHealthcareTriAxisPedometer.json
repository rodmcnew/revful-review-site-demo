      "reviewText": "After my expensive wristband thingy bit the dust (again), I decided to give this a shot to monitor my movement. I was a little weary of the price, but after spending over a hundred dollars on the wristbands, I decided to save a little. I was impressed with how accurate this is, given the lack of name brand, and all the cool functionality it has. The USB feature is pretty neat and the analysis it gives of movement is pretty nifty. Slightly larger than I would like, but doesn't bother me that much (I usually just put it in my pocket or clip it on my back side belt loop and it's not noticeable).\nHighly recommend for those on a budget or those looking to replace an expensive wristband thingy... :)",

My one complaint is that the belt clip provided with the unit could be redesigned as the pedometer will easily pop out of it.\nIf it was not for the provided tether I would have lost it several times.",

      "reviewText": "I own two of these. Did NOT want a fitbit although I could well afford one. I am in WW and I can enter the steps on this right into my online tools. I do not need canned messages. I need something to motivate me and show my progress. The one drawback is the weight. I am on WW so I have lost 42 lbs and it still has the original weight I entered but I don't care. It has a great display. It should come with a lanyard for extra security (really important or mine would have been lost- but if it doesnt they will send it free of charge). Unlike Fitbit this gives you a display of everything you need. Love it.",
