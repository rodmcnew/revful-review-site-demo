      "reviewText": "The bedding came with all of the pieces described. My daughter loves the bedding (she's 3, and pink is her favorite color). The fabric and appearance of the bedding are pretty generic and simply looking, but you get what you pay for, and it works for our needs! The comforter isn't too thin though, so it does serve its purpose!",

I've been looking for a nice set and did not want to pay an exorbitant amount which seems to be the case on many bedding websites. The comforter is thick and the bedskirt is made of durable material. Excellent product and great price!",

      "reviewText": "Was expecting a 100% polyester (silky) bedding set. The top of the cover is 100% cotton twill which is very rough! The color is nice but for the type of material its dry clean only??? The material could handle anything, it's that tough! However the cover is only tacked in a couple areas so washing it in a washer would just bunch up the filling and leave it lumpy. Ok for the occasional guest but daily use it's uncomfortable!",
