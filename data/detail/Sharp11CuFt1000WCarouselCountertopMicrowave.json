      "reviewText": "I purchased this microwave based on my former Sharp oven which finally died after 12 years of dependability. Wanted to replace it with a more updated model, anyway. After researching many microwaves and their performance reviews.. And, after trying one other brand which was too small & too loud.. I decided to settle with the basic features & product reliability of Sharp. For me, this 1.1 cu oven is not too big or too small. It takes up less space, works fine and looks classy with touch of stainless steel, assuming you don't mind cleaning extra fingerprints on the steel trim near the door latch, which also works adequately. Overall.. a good quality, nice looking moderate sized microwave which does the job for a reasonable price. Only one source of disappointment to me, being that my previous Sharp had a program function to Disable the Beeps. At least new Sharp's beeps don't seem to be as unnecessarily loud as most other brands. As far as longevity goes, I've only had this one for a few weeks so time will tell.",

      "reviewText": "This microwave is more than large enough for a household of two,it's quiet ,and good looking.The reasons this product fell short of five stars is that the button to open the door takes more effort than it should,and the key pad could be a little easier to read and more self explanatory .I would purchase this oven again for all the good things about it because they certainly out weigh the bad.Just remember that as good as that stainless steal finish looks, every time you use your greasy fingers on it you are left with noticeable finger prints .",

      "reviewText": "Good oven for the price, however I have two complaints with this oven. First, the feet let this slide. We put it in the microwave cabinet the old one sat in (which never moved the 8 years we had it) and this one kept sliding back into the cabinet so we had to keep pulling it out so it wouldn't hit the sides of the cabinet. I finally put a brace behind it so it had no room to move back to fix that problem. I guess if you are going to leave it on the countertop, that shouldn't be a problem. The second issue is keeping the touch pad clean from fingerprints. It could be the fact we have the stainless steel model but we seem to be wiping it clean everyday. Have only had it for a short while so still learning best time and temp for cooking (much different than the old one), but it's doing the job so far.",
