      "reviewText": "I was excited to find a Pok√©mon storage binder. There's really nothing to store and protect the hundreds of cards my boys have. I thought this would keep them organized and protected. When I opened it there's nothing inside it. So you have to purchase the inserts for the cards. I would think a $12 binder would at least come with some. This was a disappointing buy.",

Its an overpriced binder and I had wished my nephew could have designed the outside cover with a plain white binder. Since he requested this binder specifically then I kept it. I had to go to Walmart to buy the sleeves and spent another 6 dollars.",
