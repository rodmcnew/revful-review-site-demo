It's great, sound is excellent, picture on the TV is outstanding and I picked up a used Bose surround sound system and it sounds amazing. I love the key adjustment feature. It would never fail, the song I wanted to sing would be too high, NO MORE, this is great!!",

      "reviewText": "I have owned 2 other Karaoke machines, the first one died due to power hits, glad it did because the unit had a motor boating sound that came out of the unit. I had to turn the volume pretty high to not notice it anymore. The next one was DOA, so I returned it and gave up.\nI got this unit for my birthday, and the first thing I notice was how quiet the power supply and laser turn table was. Love this machine, my only suggestion for the unit is not have the default output as a 1080P, I had to first hook up the video output to the TV to access the menu setup to program it. Buy it have fun.",
