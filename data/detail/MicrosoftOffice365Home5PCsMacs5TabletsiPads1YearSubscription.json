      "reviewText": "We assumed it was the newest office out there. No where did we see that you only have a one year subscription!!! Office has always been stored on your computer (bought for a laptop), this says it goes into a cloud. We would have bought the 1 license for the computer had we known. We didn't know about this yearly subscription until we were trying to figure out why a card and the difference after the fact.No one seems to know what happens after the year subscription is up, where does the information go if you decide you don't want it anymore. We find it very unsettling about private information, and what happens to important documents if you miss what ever the new subscription will be.",

      "reviewText": "It's often difficult to know why some piece of software doesn't seem to work as it should, and this is true for Office 365. I installed it on one computer, a new Acer laptop, and the programs I need the most, Word and Excel, froze, crashed, performed other antics I can't describe -- it was awful. I uninstalled 365 and reinstalled it on my Acer thus burning one of five allowable installations -- if I want this version of Office on any of my other computers.\n\nThe second installation works better than the first, but neither installation provides the stability of Home and Student 2007, 2010, and 2013. Word for example, if I pause when typing when I begin again newly typed letters or numbers appear up or down two or three lines, in the middle of words, and almost anywhere but where they should be and where I had left the cursor. Excel cost me two or three hours of lost work when it crashed although I'd saved my work almost after each keystroke because it had been so erratic. When reopened, all changes were lost even though I'd saved them. Why? Who knows?\n\nMicrosoft wasn't any help at all. The tech with whom I spoke said the problem probably was with my computer, but he tried briefly to help with a takeover of the computer. After a couple of minutes, he gave up saying it was downloading too slow for him to waste any more time. I checked Speakeasy after hanging up with him, and the download speed was excellent.\n\nI'm going to try again when my regular computer is available after hard drive replacement. If it works on that machine, it's probably something with the Acer. If not, it's probably Microsoft's issue.",

Will purchase one that comes with the CD/DVD instead. Cost more but it's worth it to actually have the disk and not have to rely on the online version to try and load.",
