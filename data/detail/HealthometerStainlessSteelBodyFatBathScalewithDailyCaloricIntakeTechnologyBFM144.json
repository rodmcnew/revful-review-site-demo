      "reviewText": "I just bought this scale yesterday and my body fat percentage and bmi have changed several times,according to this scale. The changes in my weight from one minute to the next were disconcerting too,especially because I didn't eat or drink anything in between.\nI'm in serious diet-mode,so even though my weight only changed 1-3 pounds as I stepped on and off this scale last night (all within an hour,no food or drink),that was still too much variability for me,and the body fat percentage swung all over the place,as did my hydration level and bmi. I just don't think it can be all that accurate if the numbers keep changing that much for no apparent reason,and in a very short period of time.\nI bought this product in-store and the box claims it to be a \"professional body fat scale\".I would disagree. Perhaps if this were a $20 scale instead of $40 I would have expected less accuracy and it would be a better value. If you are person who isen't as concerned with these numbers,but you want just a general idea of weight,bmi,etc. this might be a better fit for you than it was for me,but I'm gonna return this one before it makes me crazy!\nBtw,it also say it stores \"all information\" for 4 users,but it only holds memory for the last 6 times you saved your weight. Also,it does not save bmi,hydration,bone density info,just weight and body fat numbers.",

      "reviewText": "Its works, I had bought from anouther store a german body fat scale, really super nice looking with all the bells and whistles for $20 dollars more than this one,the scale weight part worked but all the other stuff kept coming up error,this model bfm144-99 has the same bells & whistles for less money even the daily calorie amount. and the weight numbers seem reliable, ive gotten on and off the scale and it keeps coming up the same weight, and its weight measure is the same as my other digital scale, so it means that its the same as my doctors office scale.I tried both my scales with equal clothing in the same floor spot, both were exact. I just bought it today and setup was easy, just follow the directions. If something happens I shall update.",

      "reviewText": "The pressure sensitive switches to control the scale's saved users are on the edge of the scale, and the feet underneath them are closer to the center of the scale. When you hit the buttons with a toe, the scale tips up. The buttons themselves are hit-or-miss. Sometimes they register, sometimes they don't. Overall, much more frustrating to use than a bathroom scale should be.",

The buttons aren't button but rather...heck, I don't know what they are. They aren't touch screen and they aren't buttons. What I do know is THEY DON'T WORK. I've lost my reciept or I would take this thing back right now. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.",
