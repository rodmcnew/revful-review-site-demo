      "reviewText": "This is a great hummingbird feeder. Exactly as described. Doesn't leak & ant proof. After not having a feeder for almost 6 months (old style - leaked) we put this out on New Year's Eve in the later afternoon. Had hummingbirds the next morning.\n\nOne more thing...this was a last minute Christmas gift. Ordered online from Walmart on Dec 18. It shipped THAT day and arrived on Dec 20. Thank you Walmart!",
