      "reviewText": "I started using FireLine several years ago because that is what my favorite fishing guide used on his client tackle (I prefer to use my own). I had just returned from Brazil and the Suffix brand line I used there didn't stand up to the hard usage and constant casting involved in fishing for peacock bass. On a trip with Brad to San Antonio Bay, Texas, for speckled trout and redfish, I was having maddening roll backs and stops using the other line due to little tags of fuzz on the line. I re-spooled with Berkley FireLine from a 1500\" spool he had on board and the problems ceased. I have been using FireLine ever since with minimal casting problems. I prefer Tracer color.",
