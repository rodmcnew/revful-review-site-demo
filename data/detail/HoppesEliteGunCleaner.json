      "reviewText": "I've used Hoppe's No.9 for many years and have been pleased with it. I bought this to keep in my range bag for quick cleanups. To my surprise, I found that this product cleans as well and as quickly as my old favorite, Hoppe's No.9. Now, I keep a bottle on my work bench for regular use. Another plus (for some it may not be) is that my wife does not complain as she does about No.9. because Hoppe's Elite has practically no odor. A good product, I like it more every time that I use it.",
