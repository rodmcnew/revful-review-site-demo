      "reviewText": "The first Hex I owned had defective optics in it. It was jittery and would randomly shoot the cursor off the screen when picking up the mouse.\nI used it for 3 weeks before I fully realized that it was defective, and that it wasn't just my mouse pad or the way I was using the mouse. What really gave it away was when the mouse intermittently, and alternately, would stop traveling along the X or Y axes and traveled in straight lines instead. Just like how mechanical mice behave when they need cleaning. I returned it that day.\n\nThis one has no problems like that.\n\nThe only thing I noticed wrong with this one is that the mouse wheel squeaks sometimes when turning it. A minor issue, but it is annoying.\n\nI won't say anything else as my other comments are under \"Imapwnu\" since the web site made me pick a new name. Go figure.",

      "reviewText": "I bought two of these.\nFirst one was jittery and only got worse as I used it and eventually stopped tracking on both the x and y axes, but not at the same time.\nI returned it, and bought the second one.\nThat one worked well out of the box, although the scroll wheel would occasionally \"squeak\" when scrolling, which was annoying. Well, after 3 weeks it starting getting jittery, especially when lifting the mouse, and started to intermittently fail to track on the x axis.\nThe problems were very sporadic on the second one, but I returned it while I still could.\nI gave up on Razer and ordered a Corsair M95.",

I love this hex mouse the best, makes playing World of Warcraft a better experience.
