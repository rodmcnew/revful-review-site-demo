      "reviewText": "The Seal Team Elite is an amazing knife, but sometimes you want something a little smaller and or a full straight edged blade. That's where the Seal Pup Elite line comes in. Sharp out of the box, great edge retention under heavy use, no corrosion issues despite months in a damp field environment. Just an ideal knife all around with great balance that feels perfect in your hand.",

      "reviewText": "I bought this without seeing one in a store so wasn't sure it would be the size I really wanted. Turned out it's just perfect for my needs. Blade is thick and comes very sharp. I have the nylon sheath which has many options for how you can carry it or attach it to belt, pack, or other gear. The nylon is also quiet in the woods. The shape of the blade is perfect for camp use or to cut up game and it holds an edge well. Can't say enough good things about this knife. I'll have it for a very long time.",

      "reviewText": "I use my Sealpup just about every time I hit the woods. I have climbed mountains across New England in summer and winter as well as spent multiple day treks with my Sealpup as my primary \"everything\" tool and it has never failed me yet. This is a solid and dependable tool as functional as it is elegant. Thanks SOG for a great knife.",
