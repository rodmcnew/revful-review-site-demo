They are not baggy in the seat area and they wash and dry nicely. I am of average height and they fit me in the length also. May be too long for anyone under 5' 6\".",

I had been getting all cotton in Petite. These were avg. in a very strechty fabric.. Very comfortable but I had to shorten them a couple of inches. Still glad I ordered them.",

I just love them, was surprised that they were the right gifit at the waist.(Other slacks from chic have been very small at the waist and threw the legs.) These are super, and will purchase them again.",
