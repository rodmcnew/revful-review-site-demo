Neat & Clean installation.\nThey are very bright for their compact size.\nI've Had them for almost a year, then changed the bolts to Stainless Steel after the original bolts started slightly oxidizing.\nThe cost for a Light Kit for this same use from a motorcycle parts distributor is actually 3 times the cost of what I spent in this set up.\nI will recommend these for the price",

      "reviewText": "I wasn't happy when I discovered that I spent $40.00 for the exact same lights at the Cleveland Intntl. Motorcycle show that Wal Mart had for less than $20.00! The lights are 55w and very bright! I have them mounted on my bikes highway bars and they really light up the dead space directly in front of the bike. I had the lighted switch mounted on the right side cover. The increased visibility is amazing! I rarely ever ride at night without them on. The only minor issue I've had is that when I turn the lights on, the right side light doesn't come on and if I give it a little \"flick\" with my index finger, it comes on and stays on. Probably just a slightly loose bulb. I'm planning on removing the lens to check that out soon. I'm just happy that if I ever need a replacement, I can get them at Wal Mart for a great price!! Thank you Wal Mart!",
