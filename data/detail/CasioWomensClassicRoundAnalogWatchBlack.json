      "reviewText": "I have owned two Casio round analog watches (so far). Tough, durable, reliable and quite water resistant. I ordered one of each - man’s and woman’s models. Returned the women’s because it is quite tiny/petite/diminutive. Even when I returned it to my local Walmart store the customer service rep. remarked how small it was - “Must be a kid’s watch”.\n\nIf the little model I returned is anywhere near as good as the men’s model, this is a watch that can take a lickin’. Nice visual dial. Obviously significantly smaller then the men’s model. A LOT for the money.",
