These fit perfect and we will be buying more. She is a perfect size 6 and will be needing the 6X soon. We are so happy to finally find something that fits her.",

      "reviewText": "My daughter loved the look & fit but does not like glitter. I was disappointed that nowhere in the product description did they include such a detail that these jeans have a glitter sprinkled through the fabric (which, by the way, do tend to get on other clothes in the washing & drying process). I think they're adorable; my 12-year-old thinks they're too gaudy.",

      "reviewText": "These pants fit great. They have an adjustable waist so I think my daughter will be able to wear these for a long time. They were a bit long but I just used iron on hem to take them up. It will be easy to let them back out as she grows. They have cute designs on the pockets and are perfect with tall boots. Another good thing is they don't fit so low that underwear shows. Good price for pants to wear to school. It won't be too devastating if she gets paint or other bad stains on them.",
