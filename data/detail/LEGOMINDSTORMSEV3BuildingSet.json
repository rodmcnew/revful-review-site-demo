      "reviewText": "EV3 allows the person to stretch the imagination in so many directions. The varying possibilities with this robot is amazing. Kit comes ready to build 3 different robots and then buy a few more intel bricks and you can build a soda dispensing machine! ( my 10 yr old grandson said he is building the soda machine so I can buy my soda from it..I asked who is buying the soda to load in it, he said \"you are\" I asked who gets to keep the money put in the machine to get the soda out, he said \" I do!\". So obviously it teaches the child to think of becoming a business man..of course I would look out for the shady dealings... Overall, this kit is amazing! He collected gift card to pay for it himself and when he finally got it, he had the first bot built in a day! He changes it out, connects to the Internet to program his bricks and he is constantly searching for new ideas. He just spent a week at Disneyworl and had a blast but his mind kept coming back to EV3. After a 12 hr flight home, he went straight to EV3 to build a different robot and try it out! That's dedication and determination. I will complete this review as my grandson. He is actually 10 but the rating part doesnt allow for his age group.",

      "reviewText": "My 10 year old son (and I) love it! Easily downloaded and installed software. Built R#ptar, Track3r and Grip3r so far. Love included IR controller and Bluetooth control via mobile phone. Also downloaded & built the electric guitar (1 of 12 bonus models).\n\nThis is not an 'easy' toy for the timid. You must follow the directions, which are well done, then gain knowledge about building AND computer programming logic.\n\nWe haven't had something like this before but could see where some parts are fluff and more usable pieces would be nice. Comparing EV3 to other electric/robotic type 'toys,' I know we will more than get our moneys worth.\n\nWal-Mart - please distribute the rechargeable battery that comes with the educational set!",

      "reviewText": "I decided to get a set to build robots with my daughter. She is 9 and on the school robotics team, but didn't get to program the robot a lot this year. 'Investing' in a set (the cost means it covers birthday and Christmas!) has worked out as she can try out things at home and much more interested in programming as well as building. She tries to come up with something new everyday it seems. It will help her come next year's robotics competition. Only negative is for the price, the pieces should come in little tupperwares.",
