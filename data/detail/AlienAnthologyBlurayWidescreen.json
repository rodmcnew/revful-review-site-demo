      "reviewText": "This was on my wish list, but at $70.00 (although well worth it), I kept putting it off. Needless to say, when I saw it in store today for $35.00, I grabbed it up and I am an extremely happy camper.\n\nFirst off, great packaging. This anthology comes in a small hardcover book with an insert from director Ridley Scott. It includes 6 BR discs, (4 movie discs and 2 special feature discs). The discs all have their own page (slot) and mine were all in perfect condition.\n\nDisc 1 - Alien - 1979 Theatrical Version and the 2003 Directors Cut.\nDisc 2 - Aliens - 1986 Theatrical Version and the 1991 Special Edition.\nDisc 3 - Alien 3 - 1992 Theatrical Version and the 2003 Special Edition.\nDisc 4 - Alien Resurrection - 1997 Theatrical Version and the 2003 Special Edition.\nDiscs 5 & 6 - 50 hours of Supplemental Materials.\n\nAccording to Mr Scott, this anthology took two years to make and includes all the bonus materials from the Special Collectors Edition Laser Discs, the 1999 \"Legacy\" DVD set and the 2003 \"Quadrilogy\" DVD set. It also includes several hours of newly compiled extras that are exclusive to this \"Anthology\" release.\n\nAll 8 movies (theatrical and special editions) contain full length audio commentary. This also includes Blu-Ray only features such as interactive timelines and datastreams of production notes and historical facts as you watch.\n\nUnseen dailies, deleted scenes, in depth behind the scenes featurettes, over 12,000 pics and art stills, isolated scores including alternate and unused cues, archival documentaries, test footage, TV specials, multi-angle studies and more.\n\nBottom line - This was well worth the original price, but at $35.00, this is an absolute \"must have\". This box set also goes quite nice with the AVP Blu-Ray box set.",

      "reviewText": "I've always been a fan of the series, but Alien and Alien 3 just seemed to fall short of the other two like they were missing the action. After watching the directors cut of Alien and Alien 3 I like these almost as much as the other two. I have the other two on dvd with both versions. The picture quality is great. No fuzy or grainy transfer like some movies this old. You get 6 discs, 4 movie discs with the theatrical and directors version and 2 bonus feature discs with 50 plus hours of special features. Well worth the money for any fan.",
