I just got my first apartment and I love this curtain so much it really brought life and color to my small bathroom. It's thin and it is cloth so you can wash it in the washing machine no problem. Great for anyone who wants or needs a new and fun curtain!",

I love the light material and bright colors, so much nicer than I expected! I found one thing to be weird, the set of monkey shower curtain hooks came with 12, and my liner used all 12, however the curtain only used 11?!",
