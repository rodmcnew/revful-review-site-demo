      "reviewText": "Worked fine, but individual beads are hard to open; I need scissors for it.\nAlso, I need to dip the bead-plus-applicator in something creamy to make insertion easier. I'm using Wamart's Eucerin moisturizer for that purpose; wrote to KY company if that were safe for internal use, but they never answered, even though I included list of ingredients.\n\nNow my GP recommends cocoanut suppositries instead.",
