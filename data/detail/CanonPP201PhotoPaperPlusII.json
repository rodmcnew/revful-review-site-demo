      "reviewText": "I do aaaaaaLOT of online shoping for myself and my family; My mom has been looking for this type of photo paper for a few weeks, as her supply was gone. I asked her to give me a description of what she was looking for, and she explained that she had just bought a new Canon (Model MG 5220) photo printer/copier at Walmart, which I had recommended to her awhile back. She said that the printer came with a few 'sample' sheets, and she really liked the 4 x 6 prints that the printer produced. With her description of the paper, I was able to match the EXACT type on the website and had it sent directly to her. And my mother is 82 years old, and TOTALLY computer illiterate! But with my help (and my daughter's), she is able to provide everyone with very nice pictures of family gatherings/birthdays/holiday pics, thanks to Walmart and their fine and affordable products!! *****(5) of (5) STARS!!",
