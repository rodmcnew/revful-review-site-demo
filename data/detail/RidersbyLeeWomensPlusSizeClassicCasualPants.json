      "reviewText": "I have bought these pants from Walmart in the past & they were great, but this product has changed. It is made with cheaper material & the stitching is like a pair of jeans. These pants used to be like a pair of khaki's that was appropriate for work, this last round that I bought seem like jeans. It is called \"easy care \" I would consider that wash dry & wear, but even though I haven't washed them the material seems as though it would require ironing when taken out of the wash. I think they'll be going back , very disappointed !",

When I did the the khaki pants were either chinos or tapered ankle. Neither could be worn to work. So, I found these riders khaki pants on line not in the store. The fabrics is light and the length is great for me at 5'9 . All the pockets are active useable pockets in the front and the back. Nice work pant for the price.",
