It has big letters, numbers, and symbols, with the light it is a tool everyone one should have. The only weakness I discovered is that when the computer goes to sleep the light on the keyboard stays on.",

I like the larger keys and the lighting is terrific I have found nothing but good features. I am so glad that I made the decision to try it. In my opinion this is a great product .",

      "reviewText": "I got this for better visibility and it delivers on that. I am a 2 finger typist and it works perfect for me. Keys are bigger, and I like the lighted feature (red & purple are the easiest to see; they seem sharper/brighter than the more popular blue.). I always turn off my power strip when finished so the light always being on is not an issue with me.. Keys have a curved concave surface. Noise level is no different than my other standard keyboards. Very pleased with the product. FYI I use Windows 7 and it worked perfectly as a plug and play. Will never be satisfied with a non enhanced keyboard again. My eyes certainly won't be improving. Enjoy.",

      "reviewText": "I highly recommend this keyboard. We don't mind that it isn't wireless and we still use our wireless mouse. The 3 color choices each turned out to be good. Easier to read and use than other keyboards. The keyboard also includes hotkeys for functions like calculator, email, etc. The whole family loves it.",

      "reviewText": "The letters are big--that's good\nThe light is bright--that's good\nHowever, it sounds like a troop of bad tap dancers on a hard-plastic floor--it's really noisy.\nAlso, the letters are very unevenly lit with the light. It looks like there are a lot of smudges on them and there aren't--the smudging comes from beneath the keys. That's kind of sad, really; I'm sure it'd be an easy fix.\nIt won't remember the color of light you left when you signed off the computer--turn it on and it's always blue. If you want purple, then you have to use the switch. There really are 3 colors--blue, red, both together--purple.\nThe keys have some sideways give. That's disconcerting and makes my bad accuracy even worse.\nI would not buy another. In fact, I'll probably eventually throw it under the cupboard and get another brand.",
