      "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this product!! So accurate in every way. I was trying to conceive for 10 months after I had a miscarriage last October. No luck and it was just so stressful and frustrating for my husband and I. Then I started having irregular cycles where in June I didn't have my period and then it showed up the rest of the months ahead until September where once again no period. So my husband ordered this for me and it came on October 2 and I decided to test expecting to see nothing but to my surprise there was a smiley face. So we got down to business and the next day the same thing happened and we got down to business again.\nWell I didn't really keep track of any symptoms because I didn't want to be led down. So check this out girls, I had one First response Early result that allows you to know six day before your missed period and it was negative. Now the next day I took this very ovulation test as a pregnancy test because I heard sometimes ovulation test can detect the HCG hormone. So i did and I saw a smiley face. Went out got a pregnancy test and it was dark positive and I tested the next day because I was shocked and it was even darker.\nGood luck to all and remember even when your cycle is not regular this product is still able to detect the fertile stage it happened to me.",

      "reviewText": "These strips get really pricey if you plan on buying them every month. However it's worth buying them for a few months to really learn your body and when it typically ovulates. I really had no idea and this helped. We're only in our 1st month of TTC, so we'll see how things turn out. But so far, so good. On day 15 of my cycle, the smiley face appeared. If you have no idea when you ovulate, I strongly recommend you purchase the 20-strip pack.",

I kind of knew when I was ovulating so I only used 2 and let me tell you the second one showed up with a smiley face, which brought the biggest smile to my face, time to get to business. 9 mths later I got to give birth to my beautiful baby girl. Very very happy with this product, will use always and recommened to all that are trying to have a baby. A very very happy customer.",
