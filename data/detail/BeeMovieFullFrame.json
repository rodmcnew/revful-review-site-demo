I was told by a friend that she did not like it and was disappointed I purchased this. But what the heck we watched it.\n\nThe three of us two grown males and myself would watch it again! If you don't have a sense of humor, this is not for you.\n\nIt covers love, friendship and the desire to succeed in what feels right to him. He is not a follower but an adventurist with compassion to try the unknown.",
