      "reviewText": "Being my first non- laptop, I was a bit concerned about loading programs on it; my USB CD player took care of that in a heartbeat! As it's meant as a work backup machine, I'm unconcerned about the small (128 G) drive, but love the fact that it's solid state. Pretty fast boot, great WiFi. About the only minus is the resolution- fine for QuickBooks, but I wouldn't want to watch a movie on it (but it's a work backup, remember?). And a second USB 3.0 port would have been nice...\n\nAll in all, a nice, light, portable machine for the price.",

I like the sleek form factor, the light weight and the tactile feel of the keyboard. Also, the long battery life is very hard to beat. I may buy another one to use as a music server for my stereo.",
