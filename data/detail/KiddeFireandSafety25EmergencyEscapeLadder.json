Great price especially compared to what they charge in Canada where I live !\n\nMy only disappointment is that it is designed for a one-time use. Hmmmmm, why??? Because of this, we cannot do a fire drill with it ........ Hopefully it will work the one time we will need it.......\n\nKaren from Canada",
