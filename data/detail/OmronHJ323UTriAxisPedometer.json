      "reviewText": "I bot this over a year ago to replace an older Omron model that I lost. It took some getting used to and time to set up but so far it's been working like a charm. And I'm in the gym doing cardio and strength training 5+ days a week, plus lots of hiking on the weekends. It probably gets more sweat on it than it should but I've never had issues; unlike the previous model I had. I've had a few hicups w/ uploading the data but I think it was more a website issue than the ped issue. The ped has performed well and the battery has a long life.",

I even had it hooked to the computer for 3 hours waiting, and it would just say downloading. No hour glass, no spinning circle, no moving lines, nothing. I would not recommend this product.",
