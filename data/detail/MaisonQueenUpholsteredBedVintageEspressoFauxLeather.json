I cant believe it came all the way from Cali to the Burgh without Any box damage. All the parts were there in very good packaging. Easy setup. No box spring necessary. Looks expensive. Great bed.",

I slept on it last night with my husband, but obviously we were worried about the slats moving. Thankfully they didn't and hopefully today I can order the missing parts from the manufacturer. Other than that... I like the bed. It's very sturdy, elegant, and a steal for the price.",

      "reviewText": "My husband and I purchased this bed after finding out we were pregnant and realized I need a bed lower to the ground than the one we had. We didn't have 2,000.00 for a new bedroom set or expensive furniture store showroom piece, but still wanted something that looked nice. I loved the look right away when I saw it online and loved the price even more. So we took a chance with a walmart bed. It arrived to our house so much sooner than we expected. It was pretty easy to put together. And both my husband and I were so suprised at how sturdy it was. I mean, not just for Walmart, but for any bed.\n\nAnother reason we chose this bed was no box spring was required for our memory foam matress. The support is amazing.\n\nWe have been sleeping on this bed for a good month now and still can't get over what a deal it was.\n\nMakes my bedroom look sharp. It's sturdy. And it was a great value.\nFor anyone with the \"Walmart fears\" about cheap flimsy furniture. Don't fret!! Buy this bed!!",
