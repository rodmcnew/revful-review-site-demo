      "reviewText": "I got this bike with doubts but it is a very nice bike.\nThe frame has nice welds and most of the Shimano parts are of decent value. The makers could have used a Shimano v brake set but that would have drove up the cost. I have customized this bike with higher end Shimano parts like the crank set and front derailleur as well as V brakes. It certainly is cheaper then paying $2000 dollars for a Trek MTB. Simply put this bike is surprisingly built for what I paid.\nOne must know is that you should have some knowledge about bike adjustments and derailleurs and such not. \"big box bikes\" hardly are ever tweaked for the user and at times the buyer blames the bike company.",

      "reviewText": "I've had this bike a little over a week now, and I am very pleased with it's ride. Very smooth. Once the cables got their \"initial stretch\" out of the way, brakes and gears adjusted easily. (Leaned the adjustment process on YouTube). The ShimanoÂ® gear system shifts accurately, and the \"V-Brake\" style brakes do their job nicely.\nI ride Pennsylvania foothill streets. (Some hills are steep).\nI know that this is not a $6,000 mountain bike, nor do I plan to take it to the mountains to test its limits. But for $150, I got a great, smooth-riding bike that was easy to assemble and adjust, goes up the steepest hills with ease, and stops when I need it to for riding around my neighborhood.\nExcellent value.",

We took it back to our Wal-Mart and they replaced the tube; brought it home and it did the same thing. They offered to give refund or exchange for a different bike, because they don't carry this one.\nThis Bicycle looks amazing!\nWe were very pleased with the design,\njust wish it wasn't defective. :(",

      "reviewText": "This bike is amazing for the price and I recommend a tune up the day you take the bike out of the box or pick it up at the store. The brakes are a little difficult to adjust at first but once the bleed out, they are work GREAT!\n\nYou definitely need a seat cover because the stock one is a little hard to handle. The tires work great in the dirt or on the road. Be careful when putting on the bike pedals because if you put them on wrong you could have to do what I did and buy a new crank ($50), so be warned. Overall the bike rides smoothly, the gears shift great and haven't had any problems with the bike.\n\nAlso, if you decide to put the bike together yourself, make sure you have an Allen Wrench and a socket set! I will be buying new handlebars as well just so I can sit more comfortably on the bike. Gel seat covers range ($15-25) at Wal-Mart and work very nicely. Hope this helps further purchases",
