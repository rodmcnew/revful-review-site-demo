      "reviewText": "if only for the extension cord holding you back this saw would be incredible. as a homeowner for 20 years i have slowly switched from gas powered lawn and landscape maintenance equipment to electric.let me tell you this saw {remember a sharp blade makes the difference} doesnt hold back, it has an electric brake that shuts the machine down if engaged which is great because i remember my old gas stihl would still cut if brake on leading to premature wear. Perhaps they have rectified this since i had one, but i was happy to see the worx shut down completely. This saw chewed right threw a 16 inch diameter trunk {pine tree} with very little effort. I will be purchasing a 14 inch worx when my homelite gives out[this is also a very good small pruning saw]for the smaller pruning, i can see this saw getting a iittle heavy after a while. Homeowners dont hesitate or deal with gas[remember maintaining anything gas takes additional time and care] yard maintenance tools anymore or better yet dont get started. If you are in the market for a around the home chainsaw, this is the one for you.",

      "reviewText": "I used this to cut up a willow tree that was 3' wide. It's roots had rotten and it fell. I really put it to work as I also cut up into lumber using a chainsaw attachment. I'm going to use the rest of my 40:1 gas to start a bonfire later this year, but I still have some of that funky blue oil. I very well may never pick up a gas chainsaw again. This is not as powerful, but much simpler and easily cut through 8' of board over and over again. Maybe a different story on harder woods, but I'm sure to find out soon.",

      "reviewText": "Worx ;) as advertised. This is no timber-cutter's saw, but it does pretty much what the typical homeowner would need. Hefty and solid feeling. It will do whatever a gas saw with comparable specs will do without the hassle of fuel/oil mixing or engine maintenance. The only problem that I have encountered is the length of the extension cord, but I didn't have to drag the stuff very far to get to the saw. Be sure to follow the extension cord length/gauge guide to prevent motor overload. The 4 hp motor uses a lot of juice.",
