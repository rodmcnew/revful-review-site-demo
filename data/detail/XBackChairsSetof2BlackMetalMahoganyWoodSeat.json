Hopefully these will last without crush injuries from big butts. I placed cushions on them that were shaped like the wooden seat and they looked great and were comfortable. Got lots of positive compliments about these chairs after the meal. Don't recommend the other chairs I bought to anyone. They have the scroll design. But these work well for now. Stay tuned:)",

      "reviewText": "The new dining chairs were delivered to my house in record time with no shipping damage. I was considering 5 or 6 different models. The x back design is perfect and heavy duty. These two chairs should last me a lifetime. All i need now is cushions and plus i am building a new solid pine dining table.",

They look like they came as part of the set.We are going to put some removable cushions for our tushies. Other than that they are perfect for us. They are easy to clean up. I recommend these to anyone with kids or cats that seem to spend more time on the chairs than mom or dad.",
