      "reviewText": "Material seems to be okay. I buy on line because my Wal-Mart does not carry the style I need or like. This is my second order for jeans(not the same brand) and again the ad is misleading. Ad states elastic waistband and again the elastic is only in the back. I need all around elastic waistband. Again, I have to return my order. So disappointed in Wal-Mart. Don't their ad people know the difference between a full elastic waistband and a half waistband?? So, so disappointed. Definitely reconsidering buying clothes from Wal-Mart.",
