      "reviewText": "If you are looking for completely faux leather clogs, consider this shoe. It looks well-made and is stylish. I ended up returning the clogs because I found another vegan pair elsewhere. I would've kept them but for this. As for size, they were slightly tight on me, but probably just needed to be broken in. I would recommend this non-leather shoe for anyone seeking value in clogs. Compare the price to regular clogs that cost $85- and up.",

      "reviewText": "Nice fit all over, especially around the toes--not too narrow. And they were a comfortable, snug fit on my foot when walking when other shoes slip off my heal. I ordered the CHOCOLATE expecting the color to be a nice brown as shown; but they are actually a lighter, sort of washed-out brown so I had to return them just for that.",
