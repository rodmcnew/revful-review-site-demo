He thought it was sweet.\nOnly thing is, gotta make sure the environment is dark, really dark. Which it will mostly be because you'll be using this little guy to watch movies. I like that this guy is really portable and battery too if necessary, but I usually leave it plugged in anyways.",

It is a small dark light controlled room which is perfect for this projector to display their tv shows. The build in speakers arent great. but the kids don't mind. They just want to watch. So I play it at night before they go to bed while I work on the computer.",
