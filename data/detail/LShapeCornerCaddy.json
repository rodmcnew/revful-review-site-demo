Liked the shape of the baskets, they conformed to the shower walls nicely.\nThe shower baskets are deep and held the shampoo bottles and other shower products well. Some people complain that it is to flimsy, but if you adjust it properly, you should have no problems there. Overall it does what it is suppose to do. If you're in the market for a good Shower Caddy, this is the one. Hope this helps. :)",

      "reviewText": "This is the biggest peice of junk I have ever bought. Save your money for the nicer brand. I couldn't even get it in my shower to begin with because the spring in it was broken! Then the shelves wouldn't even stay up! They kept drooping! I would hate to see what would happen when i put my shampoo on it, clearly the shampoo bottles in the picture have nothing in them and are light as a feather so that away the shelves wouldn't fall when they were taking the picture. The peices that were suppose to be ajustable wouldn't budge, and the peices that should stay in place were all over the place! I wouldn't buy ever again! Like I said save your money for a nicer one, even if it is more expensive.",

      "reviewText": "In my opinion, these are difficult to set up but not because of design flaws or vague instructions. On the contrary, the instructions are quite clear and the parts are well manufactured. But it does take a while to get the collar-rings in place along the pole sections, and to fit the baskets tightly over each collar-ring, and then get the sections of the pole all attached. I suggest this last step should be done on the floor or table. The last step is installing it in the tub. You will want to set this as close as you can into the corner of the tub so that the baskets are made to fit tight in the corner (keeps them from shaking when you use them). The instructions do not make that last point very clear, so be forewarned --- aim tight into the corner the first time so that you do not have to try to readjust their placement after you have set them up. (Mine are 2\" from the ceiling's corner, but yours will vary.) Looks great after it's all done. And it holds a lot.",

      "reviewText": "My daughter put this together and put it up. Her only complaint was it was difficult to keep all the pieces together while getting it in the tub. I think this is true for all shower caddys though. It looks nice, works well. My kids like that it has 4 baskets (rather than the 2 baskets and 1 flat tray of the previous one they had). It seems to be of good quality, but it's been in use for only a week so far. I don't expect these to last a real long time as they are metal and they are exposed to water all the time. I think for the price paid, it's a good deal.",
