      "reviewText": "I teach high school chemistry and have a lot of experience with a lot of different types of scientific calculators and this is by far my favorite! It has a 2-line display so you can see what you typed and what the answer is at the same time. That makes it much easier if you made a mistake to see where you made it. Also it includes every function we ever need plus more.\n\nThis calculator does not have a memory for programs like a graphing calculator which makes it more likely to be allowed to be used on standardized tests and in large college classrooms where they don't want to clear memory for every student. It is also 5-10 times cheaper than a graphing calculator, so I really think it is a much better value for your money!",

This TI-30XIIS is great for students who don't need all the functions that a more sophisticated, graphing calculator might have. You can't beat this price!",
