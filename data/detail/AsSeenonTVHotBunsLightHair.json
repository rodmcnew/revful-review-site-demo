      "reviewText": "I never buy As seen on TV products, but so glad I did this time! This hair tool is fantastic & easy to use. Great for when Im in a rush, it takes 2 secs to make a bun and holds all day long. The only this that I dont like about the product is the elastic band thats connected to it. There is no reason for it. The product works ALOT BETTER without the elastic band. Using the elastic band made the bun terrible and made it fall down after a while. So I just dont use the elastic band and my bun is fine. Love this product!",

I was shocked this worked considering I break hair accessories sometimes just trying to get my hair in them.",

      "reviewText": "This contraption isn't worth the money and doesn't work at all like shown on TV!!! I could get it to roll up, but the rubber band that's supposed to hold it isn't long enough to pull over the bun. By that time, the bun is all undone. I finally just threw it away. Last time I buy anything that is \"as seen on TV\". What a disappointment and waste of money!",
