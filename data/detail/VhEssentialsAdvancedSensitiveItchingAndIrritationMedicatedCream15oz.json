This product sooths and heals it faster than anything else I have used, including prescription medications. I CAN'T BELIEVE WAL-MART PULLED IT FROM THEIR SHELVES IN MY LOCAL STORE. I can, at least, can order it and have it delivered to my home.",

I tried others before finding this one and they burned really bad and had to be washed off immediatly, but this one took all the discomfort away. I am glad to see I can buy it online because Walmart doesn't carry it any longer. I highly recommend it.",
