      "reviewText": "Carry daily. Design is great, assisted opening takes a sec to get use to. My only issue with this device is that even while the lock is engaged, there is a possibility of the blade sticking out of the grip while in my pocket. This has lead to me stabbing myself on the first occasion, snagging the inside of my pockets with the blade a couple, and having to check it every time before I take it out. Otherwise... Great product.",

I use the slimjim as my backup \"gentlemen carry\" knife to my other SOG full size tanto points. As a general point, I have become a huge fan of SOG. Their blades are superior and their customer service is as responsive as their open assist.",
