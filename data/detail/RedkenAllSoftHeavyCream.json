I switched to another product for a short amount of time just to try something new and my hair became damaged from the from the keratin. I decided to switch back to this and my hair looks amazing again. I use this product on my daughters hair also and it makes her hair super soft and way more manageable. Also make sure to use the shampoo.",

I got the same result on my natural hair when I used this as a deep conditioner. I left it in my hair with a plastic cap for 1/2 hour and rised it out completely. This application left my hair was soft and shiny. I really love the way my hair feels!",

      "reviewText": "I recently bleached my hair blonde from medium brown. My normal healthy hair went to complete straw. It was damaged and i could barely comb it even with tons of oil and coconut oil treatments. I would recommend this to anyone that has terrible damaged hair. After leaving it on my hair for about 10 minutes everyday my hair in the shower my hair was awesome when paired with the liter shampoo that you can get almost the same price as walmart sells the tiny bottle. I also stopped styling my hair. I cant go a day without washing it. I stopped scrubbing my hair into a ball in the back of my head with the nexus shampoo and just gently rubbing it in my hair from root to tip. That helped a lot of with the tangles. After just two weeks of this stuff my hair is basically normal. It had totally restored my hair. I told my friend about this who always has over processed hair and she loves it as well. I did recieve mine in a tube resembling toothpaste 10z instead of the tub like the picture. Either way customer for life!",
