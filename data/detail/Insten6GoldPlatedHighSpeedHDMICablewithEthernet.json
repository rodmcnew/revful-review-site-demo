      "reviewText": "Please don't fall for the hype about \"better\" digital cables. A digital signal only requires a clear path in order to transfer the information from your blu-ray player to your TV. There's absolutely no reason to spend your money on some \"Monstrously\" overpriced cable. All you need is a cable that meets the latest requirements of the HDMI association. Save yourself some cash and buy a new blu-ray disc instead of wasting your money on voodoo technology claims.",
