      "reviewText": "I bought this lens primarily to shoot birds in flight since my Nikon 1 V2 doesn't do a good job in that regard with the FT-1 adapter. It is simply outstanding for this purpose. I have been using the electronic shutter at 15, 30 and 60 frames per second and have gotten wonderful results capturing birds in flight. This lens focuses lightning fast and with the high frame rate of the V2 it is possible to capture 'the right moment' as a bird is flying past or landing. I really love the small size of this lens when coupled with the V2...the viewfinder on the V2 is worth the extra money....especially if you are used to shooting with a DSLR. My other two cameras are a D800 and a D7000. Highly recommend this lens for birding and nature.\n\nIf Nikon ever made a 100-300mm zoom for the Nikon 1 system I would buy it in a heartbeat.",

      "reviewText": "I think this is a very good match the astonishing and amazing Nikon 1 V2 camera. There is just enough zoom to reach out for most everyday pics. I wish it was a little bit faster at max zoom of action shots, but I can live with this now that I am aware of the limitation. It is a good companion for my 10-30mm and 18.5mm f/1.8 lenses. The combination of these three will cover most of my immediate needs for portraits, nature, grandchildren in action and urban scenes.\n\nSurprisingly, low light shots are quite impressive when the camera is stable. I can already see that only one or two additional lenses will round out my camera bag.\n\nThis is going to be a good year of photography!",

      "reviewText": "I bought this as the telephoto for the Nikon 1 camera since I also have the standard 10 to 30mm lens. This lens is fast focusing on this camera and gives excellent pictures at the 35mm equivalent of about 80mm to nearly 300mm. It has a maximum aperture of F/3.8 and focuses down to about a meter. I only wish that the color of the lens was the same as the color of my camera body, but that color does not appear to be available as a separate lens.",

      "reviewText": "Having experienced the N1 V1 with the excellent wide-angle and 10-30 zoom lenses for a couple of weeks, I decided to purchase also he 30-110 mm zoom lens. I like the 30-110 mm zoom very much, it delivers sharp results with nice colors and good contrast. Apart from this, the strongest feature of this zoom lens is its really tiny size: it is a 70-300 mm equivalent that disappears in your hand. And it weighs almost nothing. The N1 system is simply a fantastic and very capable small camera system. Highly recommended.",
