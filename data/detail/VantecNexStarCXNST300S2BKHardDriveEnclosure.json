      "reviewText": "Item was as described. Worked out of the box. Rather slow on large data transfer using USB 2.0. Copied 300 Gb of data to an installed WD 500 GB HDD and it took about 5 hours from a 2.5 GHz Processor dual core machine. Quite happy with the purchase however and with WM ship to store speed of delivery. Runs fairly cool.",

      "reviewText": "After my old computer died, I ordered this drive enclosure to recover some data still on the old hard drive. It only took a few moments to plug the drive into the enclosure and secure it with the supplied screws. Plugged in the USB cable and in no time I was accessing the information on the old drive. Easy to follow instructions and sleek style made this a great buy at the price.",
