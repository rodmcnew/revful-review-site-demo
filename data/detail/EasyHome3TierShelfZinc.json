      "reviewText": "I'm using this in my kitchen for blender, crock pot, etc. Very nice looking and the price is outstanding for the quality. It took me about 15 min. to put together...so simple!! I did use a rubber mallet to help tap the shelves into place though. Note: There are 8 unnecessary? \"o\" rings that come with it that are not listed in the instructions or on the diagram. Instead of throwing them away or keeping another \"I don't know what to do with these things\", I created my own use for them. I unscrewed the height adjustment bottom peg portion, placed the ring at the bottom #large opening up# of the leg and then screwed the height adjustment peg back into the unit through the o ring. Adds a little height and may also be good if you want to add casters to it later on. Still have 4 left though. Hmm, now what can I use those for. :)",
