      "reviewText": "This bag is advertised as \"move away from the bulky\" and promoted as an accessory for Compact Interchangeable camera Nex5. Do NOT purchase this bag unless you want a HUGE bag for your little compact camera. We received this item and very upset it was recommended for the compact camera. I'll keep it for my larger camera equipment because it is a nice bag and not worth steps to return. Uploading pics to give you a realistic image. It is perfect for large cameras with lots of pockets but doesn't make sense to be presented as an accessory for compact cameras. Hope Sony fixes that!",

If you added like another small pouch on the side or tweaked the sides a little it would of helped the look of this bag SOO much better.",

      "reviewText": "Excellent made bag but advertised as an accessory for the NEX5 compact camera. This bag is FAR from not being bulky and TOTALLY defeats the purpose of owning a COMPACT interchangeable camera. Sony should seriously consider not adding this as an accessory for the compact camera or representing it as a compact non-bulky unit. This bag is bigger than my full size camera with extra lenses. It is a nice bag that is made well and with plenty of room. It is not at all feminine looking as presented by another review. If you don't like the rounded look, open the pouch (right side) pictured a drink container which will square off the bag. Sony, please rethink about your description: \"Move away from the bulky, traditional gear of the past...\" It's HUGE for a compact! I give a 5 Star rating for quality, design for larger cameras or someone who realizes this bag is not compact but offers lots of storage and compartments.",
