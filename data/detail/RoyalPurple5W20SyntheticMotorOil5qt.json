If you looking to give your engine some TLC and look for better performance, try this! Doesn't matter if you have over 75K Miles on your car, just as long as your car has been well taken care of and, changed your oil on the Scheduled times, this will work with your car.",

I have used Mobile 1 and Lubro Moly, after switching to Royal Purple I no longer have dry start knock after days of just sitting that was present while using the others. I love this oil. Thanks to Cody Bartkowiak from tech support for the quick answers to my questions.",

While gas mileage gains would be silly to speculate, I can tell you that every motor I've ran Royal purple in has experienced a longer than expected oil life. I'm a fan for life.",
