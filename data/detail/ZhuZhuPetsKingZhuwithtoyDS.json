      "reviewText": "I preordered this Nintendo DS game from Walmart in October expecting to get the Kung Zhu hamster gift that comes with it at this price, however all I got was the cartridge game. I am very disappointed because I could have gotten this game somewhere else for half price had I known it was indeed not coming with the limited edition Kung Zhu! Be careful what you order on here!",
