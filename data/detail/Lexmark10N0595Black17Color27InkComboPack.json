      "reviewText": "Lexmark ink cartridges are over priced, so I typically try to shop around in order to find the best/lowest price on them. Although I've been able to locate and purchase Lexmark ink cartridges for considerably less money then what they cost at Walmart, I have also been repeatedly disappointed due to purchasing several inferior quality ink cartridges. For example, the inferior quality ink cartridges tend to quickly run out of ink, the ink flow is inconsistent, and at times, there isn't any yellow ink at all. Consequently, I decided to spend the extra money this time by giving Walmart a try on this particular item.\n\nAfter several weeks of printing now with the Walmart purchased Lexmark ink cartridges, I am very pleased to report that there has been absolutely no issues whatsoever with these ink cartridges.",

      "reviewText": "A few days ago, I listed all the reasons why LEXMARK hits the mark. It's a very clean and professional product and I enjoy printing using these cartridges. I have made at least 50 copies and/or printings by now, not one has been smudged or in any way un useable. I am so glad I turned to WalMart to get them. Every other place I checked, either didn't carry them, had those nasty re-inked things, priced them too high or didn't even know what I was talking about. At WalMart, the price is definitely right! So if you need them, don't hesitate to buy them.\n\nIt's good to know that you can rely on something in this crazy world of ours anymore. It's time to re-order and I'm on it!!!",
