The speaker phone feature works well and the microphone in the phone is very sensitive. I am very satisfied for this phone. I especially like the battery backup feature.",

I purchased from you & received the two additional extensions in two days! I followed the instructions to hold the locator on the base phone for 5 seconds, then plug in the new extension. It was \"registered\" automatically, and all the info I had programed into the base phone was instantly duplicated onto both new extensions. Good design, great product!",
