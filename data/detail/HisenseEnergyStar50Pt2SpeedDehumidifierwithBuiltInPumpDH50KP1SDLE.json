      "reviewText": "Live in Eastern part of West Va about 85 mi West of Washington, D.C. Purchased product in July 2014 for in basement (1056 sq. ft.' which is divided into two unfinished rooms) after central air-conditioning was installed. Product was easy to set up - I ran the included drain tubing up to and across ceiling and down into a sink. Basement no longer has a musty smell when closed up and very humid outside. Basement also feels cooler than when I ran our old unit (another brand) which made it noticably hotter down there.\n\nMy daughter and son-in-law bought the 70 pint unit for their basement and are also very satisified with it.\n\nSpoke with the compay and was told that if left running continuously it only uses 1600KW per yr. Will have to monitor the electric bill and see how it is effected.\n\nFound directions easy to unmderstand - Keeps basement at 48% humitity on continuous setting.\nWould highly recommend either the 50 or 70 pint units.",

Purchased another unit just like it at another store only to encounter the heat issue.",
