      "reviewText": "Yes, I am pleased with my purchase. I purchased 2 for the price of one as I was pricing online before I came across on Walmart's web. Made well, not cheaply sewn together. My grandson, who the purchase was for, is very happy with his new addition to his new room. Brightens up the room with brilliant colors and can be paired with many other colors as well. Perfect gift for a little boy in sports. Thank you!",

      "reviewText": "I purchased 2 sets for my boys (age 3 &7). I received them and was pleased instantly! It came in a cute package, neatly packed, and labeled (fitted, flat,ect.) The colors are very bright and my 7yr. old exclaimed over how soft it was. I agree with him and love the feel of the fabric it feels sort of silky. I just received it today so I cant confirm how the color holds after a wash or two but it looks like a material that will have a lot of wear and still have saturated color. I am very pleased with everything about this set!",
