      "reviewText": "I would give this a lower rating if I could I bought this product about a month ago we couldn't afford much & are in new housing on the military base Fort Polk, La\n\nThe bed frame itself is a good starting feel & look but it is a bit plain. In the first week it was amazingly comfortable but after that the boards that support you & the mattress.... start breaking & coming apart these boards that come with it are very thin & small & it amazes me how it could even support a small child. I am very disappointed with this product & wasted 200$ that could have been used to find a better bed-frame at goodwill or a yard sell! During the time I slept on this bed I have gained back pain,neck pain & muscle pain & so has my husband. Getting sleep has been hard which is not good being that he is a military soldier & does not get much sleep as it is. It has gotten to the point where we are just sleeping on our mattress & took the bed frame in the separate room we were trying to find out if it has a warranty but can not figure it out it was suppose to come with a certain amount of day warranty. The only good thing about this product is the ease of putting it together at first but soon i had to do some handy work on it to keep it together not worth the money,time, or labor",

      "reviewText": "Easy to put together, in under an hour, light weight, finished product looks great just like the pic.\nThis bed came in two boxes, minimal pieces which made putting it together a snap. Its very sturdy, great support. Keep in mind this is opinion from my experience, im a small dude, I weigh 119 pounds, stand 5\"5. Easily supports a heavier person, as I frequently have buds over and four of us can share the bed for a movie. The color is awesome, Would have gotten a Platform bed sooner if I knew how much better my mattress feels sitting on the platform instead of the ole box spring! Yes, materials are cheap and you will wonder how on earth these light weight sticks and plastic pieces will hold you up, but once you put it together, you'll see how it holds up together sturdy, strongly, and beautifully. Been using it for two months now and love it. My favorite features are the \"height\" and the SWEET support I get now that I got rid of the old box spring, definately recomend if you're on a budget and need a space saver with minimal bulk.",
