      "reviewText": "I have been using Write 'n Stick phone message books with happy success for years. Because they stick they don't have a tendency to fall behind the desk and get lost when a breeze comes through the office on a day nice enough to have the windows open or when somebody is overly cranky and slams a door to make a point. They can be re-stuck multiple times before loosing their sticky. If you write fairly small there is plenty of room for writing notes. I recommend purchasing these from Walmart; the office supply stores charge twice as much for the same item.",
