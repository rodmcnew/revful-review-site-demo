      "reviewText": "Great VHF radio, Bluetooth feature is great. Being able to stow your phone and still take calls is very useful. Only downside is the menu setup is not simple, if your out on the water and need to change settings and do t have the manual good luck! All that said I would recommend this product, does want it says on the box.",

JUST REMEBER TO PRESS ABOUT 4 SECONDS TO MAKE IT GO INTO PAIRING MODE WHEN YOU ARE FIRST SETTING IT UP. AFTER THAT IT IS A BREEZE. IT PAIRS LIKE A DREAM WHEN YOU GET NEAR THE RADIO I FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER BEING ABLE TO TALK ON MY IPHONE AND NOT TAKE IT OUT ON THE DOCK AND WORRY ABOUT LOSING MY EXPENSIVE NEW IPHONE 6 OVER THE SIDE.
