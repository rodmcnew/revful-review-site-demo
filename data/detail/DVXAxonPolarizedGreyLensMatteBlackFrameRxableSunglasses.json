      "reviewText": "You can get these with prescription lenses. They look a little funny with a Rx because the lenses look like they're pushed into inserts instead of just lenses into the frames. They definitely look weird, and different than any sunglasses I've ever owned. They take a little getting used to but I am happy with them. Total with polarized Rx lenses was $130 so you can't really beat that. They're a little heavy and tight on my face but the weight doesn't bother me and I like tight fitting sunglasses. I had a pair of Oakley gascans and they were so big they fell off my face whenever I bent over so I really like how tight these are on my mug. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Rx sunglasses.",

      "reviewText": "Just received my DVX Axon sunglasses and couldn't be more satisfied. The fit is great and the sides keep the sun from my eyes. The clarity is the best of any sunglasses I've owned, and I have owned many, including a pair of RX at over a$100, many years ago, that I still own. I am blind in one eye and the light bothers me tremendously, with these there is very little problem.\nI looked at the same ones at a Harley dealer and they were about $40 more. I would definately buy another pair and am considering doing that just in case. The shipping was excellent, picked them up 8 days after ordering them.\nI highly recommend these if you need a great pair of sunglasses.",
