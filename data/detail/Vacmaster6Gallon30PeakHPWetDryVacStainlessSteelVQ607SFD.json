      "reviewText": "Bought this vac because I needed a small wet/dry vac for use around the house. Upon receiving it, I was pleasently surprised at how many different accessories came with it. Assembly is quite easy. Just fit the four casters to the tank, secure the carrying handle to the top of the motor and you are pretty much set. Vac is very quiet yet powerful for a vac in this price range. I would definitely recommend this vac for sure. I have an industrial 20 gallon wet dry vac I use for commercial floor stripping use but is a bit cumbersome for \"in the house\" use so this Vacmaster is definite the ticket. Well pleased with this purchase.",

I have been using it all weekend, cleaning up dog hair and debris, getting into corners, ability to go high and get cob webs, cleaning under bird cages, etc. Within this initial stages its everything I need. However, we shall see in the long run how it holds up to this kind of use.",

The tools work well. Also, it came in very quickly through Walmart's site-to-store. The price is very reasonable considering the quality and usefulness.",
