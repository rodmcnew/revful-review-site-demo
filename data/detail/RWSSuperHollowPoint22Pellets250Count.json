      "reviewText": "Absolutely the most consistently accurate projectile I have found. I have a stoeger 20x and it can hit a 1\" bullseye consistently at 35yd. This pellet will also penetrate thru a 1/4\" wood lath stake at 85yds!!! No wonder it's the best seller. RWS knows what they're doing with this design.",
