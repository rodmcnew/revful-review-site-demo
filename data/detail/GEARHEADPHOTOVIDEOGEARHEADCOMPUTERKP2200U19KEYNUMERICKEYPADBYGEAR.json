      "reviewText": "I purchased this unit because of the price. But am impressed with the limited lifetime warranty.\nI only have 2 complaints:\n1. the \"000\" key is worthless for basic financial data entry. And I removed it because I was hitting that key instead of the \"0\" key.\n2. the unit tends to creep foward because the little rubber pads on the bottom are just too small to prevent movement.",

I plugged the USB into the laptop, Vista loaded the right drivers and in about 15 seconds it was installed and working properly. My experience with site to store has been very positive. I paid at time of order with Paypal and it was there when they said it would be.\nOverall the product looks and works as advertised and I would recommend it to anyone.",

      "reviewText": "If the user's wrist angle is natural and straight, the bottom edge of the keypad can prevent the thumb from fully pushing down on the ZERO key. So the wrist needs to be at a slightly higher angle so that the thumb points slightly down in order to get a full push on the ZERO key.",
