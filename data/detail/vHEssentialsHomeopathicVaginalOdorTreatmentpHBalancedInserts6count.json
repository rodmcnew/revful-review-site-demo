I am also using the Homeopathic treatment along with the Prebiotic Supplement. I am truly satisfied with this product. Every womans body reacts different to any kind of medicine but ladies give it a try. It's worth the money and saves you a trip to the Doctors office.\nTHANK YOU VH ESSENTIALS!!! $",
