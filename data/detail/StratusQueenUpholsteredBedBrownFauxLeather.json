      "reviewText": "This queen bed was missing slats and attachments for slats. Without the slats, the bed is not useable as is. I've contacted the company 5 times via phone and email (as per the company's request) for the missing items to be sent to me. NO RESPONSE has been provided to my requests for parts; in fact, I have no contact from a rep addressing my concerns at all.\n\nYou are better off buying a different bed where you can obtain all the parts! I had to spend extra to get slats to fill in the missing sections, as well as extra padding to cushion my bed so I don't feel the metal beam in the center of the bed.\n\nI do not recommend this bed. I will not buy from this company again.",
