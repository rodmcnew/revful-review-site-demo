I didn't expect this to be nice of a product. I was able to fit 2 Laundry baskets of toys into this one toy chest. I will be purchasing another one!",

Great for light-weight storage, since it is flimsy, but works great for us - exactly what I expected. And makes clean-up a breeze for the girls - just toss everything back in the box.",

TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS ONLY 13.00 AND SOME CHANGE SO I PURCHASED TWO OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOME CHEAP FLIMY MATERIAL, BUT THIS IS A HEAVY BOARD CONSTRUCTION, ACTUALLY IT IS VERY HEAVY. I MEAN I WAS SO SHOCKED HOW NICE, STURDY AND COLORFUL THIS TRUNK IS. WELL, I WILL BE ORDERING SEVERAL MORE UNTIL THEY RUN OF OF STOCK.\nMEO",

      "reviewText": "It was far better than I expected. I honestly thought i might get some cheaply made fabric with a thin piece of cardboard to hold the shape. Instead it was made with a thicker durable fabric. My kids love it, i got one for my princess and the Cars one for my son who is 2. Both of my kids have proven that these things can take a pretty good beating and still be usable. High recommended!!",

This product does not support the weight of anyone so it's exactly made to store toys or any other items. The design is great and it is easy to fold up should we decide to replace it with a sturdier toy box.",
