      "reviewText": "I have had this desk for two years now and it is great. It is easy to put together and you can attach the shelves on either side of the desk. It is very durable. I have my TV (24\") and cable box on the top tier, printer on the bottom, and my books in the middle. I love how functional this desk is and this is why my mom is buying the same desk. Buyer should know that the shelves are not all the same size. The top two are (LxW) 20\" x 14\"; and the bottom is 20\" x 24\". What I most love about this desk is that it is glass because it doesn't look like a big clunky, chunky piece of furniture in my small bedroom!",

      "reviewText": "While I was remodeling my house last month I decided to sell my 17 year old cherry wood desk. My old desk was huge, heavy & it took up half of my room, it never matched my other furniture & it was hard to pick up/move around so I wanted to buy something opposite of what I had. I looked at a lot of different desks online & in stores until I found this one... it was perfect for me! It is exactly what I wanted... clean, simple, modern, not too big or heavy, & it easily holds all of my things (computer, printer, lamp, ink pens, papers, ect.). The sliding tray under the desk easily holds my keyboard, wrist rest, mouse & mouse pad. It fits perfectly in front of my bedroom windows with plenty of room on each side. My bedroom was so cramped up before & now I have plenty of room. The shiny black metal desk frame feels solid with thick, heavy tempered glass shelves/desktop. The book shelf can be installed on either the left or right side & the bottom shelf is a little bigger than the top two shelves. My printer fits great on any of the 3 shelves. The ONLY complaint I have about this desk is that it was a little hard to put together. It might be only mine, but they didn't drill the holes big enough to fit the screws to attach the keyboard/mouse tray onto the frame of the desk so I had to buy slightly bigger screws at Walmart to make the hole bigger, then use the screws that came with this desk. It took me a couple of days, but I was finally able to put it all together! If I didn't have to fight with the holes/screws, this desk wouldn't have been that hard to put together. Overall, I am very happy with it!! I hope it lasts me a very long time.",
