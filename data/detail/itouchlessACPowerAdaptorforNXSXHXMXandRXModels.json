      "reviewText": "I bought this adapter for my itouchless waste can and am pleased with the purchase overall. The only complaint I have is that the adapter prong does not lay flat against the can. I sticks out and prevents you from putting can flush against the wall and if you have light colored walls, as I do, it leaves black scuffs every time it rubs against the wall. It would have been better to design with a \"flat\" connector. Maybe you won't have this problem if you are able to place can at an angle in a corner.",

The one I received has a fat plug as the base, as you can see the one in this picture has a skinny plug base. IF you are ordering it fir the Itouchless garbage can, do not waste your time!",
