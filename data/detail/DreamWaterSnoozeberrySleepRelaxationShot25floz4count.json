      "reviewText": "I purchased 10 (4 pack) of the Snoozeberry and received 4 (4 pack) of Snoozeberry and 6 (4 pack) of Tea (which I did not want or ordered.) I checked the return policy and felt a return wasn't possible for the six items in the time given. We have two stores in our area and neither sells this anymore.\n\nI use this product daily and trust the reliability of it. I found the price more than reasonable here. The ease of ordering and receiving the order were great. My only suggestion would be to make sure you're specific in the comments section when ordering and maybe double checking before these orders go out.",

      "reviewText": "My sleep disorder is so bad that I have to take prescription meds. When I have run out of meds (late getting refills), I have supplemented with over the counter stuff, such as melatonin. The \"sleep meds\" do nothing for me. Melatonin helps, but I build up a tolerance to it over time. Dream water works very well for me. As a matter of fact, I'm not used to having such long dreams. It has definitely improved my sleep and have been able to not rely on caffeine so much. The only drawback, is that I have to drink two bottles to get the best sleep and this stuff is overpriced at the moment. Once it gets down to around a dollar a bottle, I'll feel much better about it.",
