If you are not new to sewing, the informational part may be boring, but you might enjoy making some of these skirts.\nThe book guides you through making your own pattern based on your body size and then using that pattern to make the dress. Very helpful. Very fun.",

The book is very attractive, gives clear, detailed instructions, and inspires creativity, which she has a great deal of! There are options here for everyone to find at least a couple of ideas for any taste.",
