      "reviewText": "I've never bought denim shorts from Walmart before, so these were a very pleasant surprise! The material is soft and comfy, more like a thicker chambray than a stiff denim. They feel already broken in and won't be too hot for a warm summer day. My usual size 6 was a perfect fit, and the quality easily matches (or exceeds) many other stores. How about some more colors, Walmart?!",

      "reviewText": "I love how these fit. I have also never purchased shorts from Walmart, so I was delighted to discover just how well these fit. They're light enough that I can't definitely see myself wearing these well into the summer, and probably into the fall too. They're also A LOT cheaper than comparable shorts at department stores. I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future.",
