      "reviewText": "Setup was simple and well-outlined in the instructions booklet. I personally tend to be intimidated by furniture that requires assembly, but I had no problem at all with this. I would absolutely recommend this desk for anyone looking to host a dual monitor setup or just looking for more a little more space - I use two monitors, I keep my drawing tablet and mouse up on the top surface in front of them, and I still have more than enough work space for everything else.\n\nWhile this desk is a bit bigger, it's far from being too large for a small living space. It hardly takes more space than a cheap student's desk would, and is also far more sturdy. I would actually say that it's the sturdiest desk I've ever owned. It's much nicer than the stock picture lets on!",

Also, has plenty of room for my two monitors, large keyboard, mouse, and still plenty of room to be able to study with a text book and notepad.\n\nVery pleased with this product.",

      "reviewText": "This desk exceeded my expectations. Wal-mart had the best price by far, but I was still skeptical about the quality until I received it and put it together. It was a little challenging to assemble but not as difficult as some reviewers stated. Two people made the job much easier. The desk is very sturdy and looks great! I did not rate the durability because I have only had it a few weeks.",

      "reviewText": "I bought this desk when I needed to switch from an L shaped desk, so I still wanted that wide surface. I couldn't find many glass desk that would be more than 40\" wide, but this one is. And it's pretty deep, so there's really a lot of working space. Assembly was easy, desk seems sturdy. I have had it for about two weeks now, and really like it. The only thing I don't like about this desk is that there's no hole on the top for my monitor and speaker cables to run down, so I can't push the desk flush against the wall. Overall, good product for the price.",
