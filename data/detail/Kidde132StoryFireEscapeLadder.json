      "reviewText": "In the instructions for this item it says to only deploy it once and then throw it away. It also says to throw it away after 10 years even if it has not been used.\nMy family planned on practicing with this item numerous times so we would be prepared for the real thing. Why on earth would it say to throw it away after one use??????\nMaybe the fabric is inferior and will rip on the first use. I can't decide rather I should take a chance and deploy it once or just throw it under the bed and hope we never really need to use it.I would recomend you buy a product that can be used more than one time. Thanks and happy shopping.",

It appears very sturdy and of good quality and I wouldn't be afraid to step out on it to escape a fire.\n\nOne thing to know is that it has packing materials in the box so open it and discard all the packing so the ladder will be ready to go if you ever need it.\n\nI have mine under the bed right next to the window in case of an emergency.",

I just reviewed it, and now know what to do if I ever need it.\nMany people dont stop to think who live in apts that this is also a great investment for them.",
