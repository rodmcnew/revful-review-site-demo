      "reviewText": "I purchased this piece online because it looked very nice and like it would suit my needs. The instructions are almost no help. The pieces aren't labeled at all so you spend a lot of time trying to figure out which piece is which by the shoddy (and seemingly hand-drawn) pictures. The doors didn't close when it was all assembled because they were pushing into the side. There are 3 magnets that requre 2 screws apiece to attach to the frame and there are no starter holes which can lead to having to screw them in and then having to unscrew them to move them to make room for the door. The screws (all 16 that I used!!!) themselves are so soft they became stripped almost immediately by my simple Sears screwdriver and I had to used a pair of pliers to get the screws 95% of the way in and finish them with a screwdriver. Finally, the pieces you attach to the back didn't fit in the space provided as well.\n\nUltimately, I now have a shelf with no doors and no back.",

      "reviewText": "Not the highest quality. Looks like cheap veneer. Perfect for a toy room or kids room- not a living room. Had to send ours back because they arrived damaged and the screws to hold the shelves are on the outside sides and not flush with the particle board-scratched our other furniture that was next to it. A great value but not a good fit for us.",
