      "reviewText": "Shipping was super fast (and free). Arrived 1 day early. Picture quality is superb and sound is excellent.\nI must note that some reviewers were unhappy w/ the sound because the speakers are in the back of the set. This issue is easily fixed by going into the sound menu and switching it to \"surround sound\". THIS TURNS ON THE FRONT SPEAKERS! When you scroll down to the surround sound option, it even indicates something along the lines of \"surround sound for front speakers use\". But however, in my opinion, its plenty loud enough w/ out the front speakers on.\nI would highly recommend this set to anyone sick of wasting time and money on mediocre TV's that conveniently \"turn off by themselves\" right after the warranty expires.\n...I would like to add that this TV is very attractive as well. W/ a thick/heavy tempered glass stand and sleek ultra-thin frame, its nice to look at even when turned off. The remote that comes w/ it is super sleek and modern looking as well. W/ chrome accents on the scroll button.\nFinally. A decent TV at a decent price. You will not be dissatisfied w/ this product.",

      "reviewText": "I've always been hesitant to buy a \"low end\" TV. I've had 3 Samsung's and have had great luck with them. I had a 32\" Samsung in the bedroom and wanted something larger. I found this online and thought I'd give it a shot. Wow, am I glad I did! I got it for $279 last week. Granted, I've only had it a week but so far I'm quite impressed with the picture and sound. I've read other reviews about the sound being weak. I went into the settings and played around with the EQ and it made it a lot louder. The picture is very good. I haven't noticed any lag or motion blur. I have my PS3 hooked up to it and soon my PS4 will be and the games look amazing on it. If you're in the market for a 42\" LED, don't pass this one up!",

I had been watching pricing on TVs for some time and this RCA was the best I ever saw.\n\nThe picture is excellent and we have had no problems with the sound. We did check to make sure we had the TV configured to surround sound as one reviewer said. Our TV defaulted to surround sound.\n\nSetup was easy. After unboxing it, my husband had it put together within 15 minutes. We have it down in my husband's Man Cave, but I will be looking to buying another one for our Family Room.\n\nSo far our experience has been flawless.",
