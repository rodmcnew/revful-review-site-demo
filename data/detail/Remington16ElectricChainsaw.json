      "reviewText": "I have been using Remington electric chain saws (usually 16\"), for 20+ years, and have tried 3 other brands, most of which now sit in a junk pile. It helps lots that I know how to prevent major kinks while using them (don't twist the blade, be thoughtful/clever in freeing the blade if it gets pinched in the wood, don't use a dull chain).\nWhy I love my REMs (currently using an RM1635W):\n* Low cost but amazingly strong-- I have never had a motor burn out.\n* Last many years, for firewood, felling trees upto 12\" diameter plus.\n* The REMs are simple enough to make improvised repairs---\nI used an improvised repaired REM for many years afterwards.\nTheir flaws (and which chain saws don't have flaws?):\n* Most oil feed systems are iffy. Instead, I just apply oil onto the blade with a squeeze bottle after most heavy cuts (done that for years).\n* The RM1632A & RM1635W (16\") have a simple, but maybe weak, tensioning part, which is where you may need to be careful, or skilled. Mine's doing fine, and I figure I can easily replace that part if it breaks.",

      "reviewText": "I only use a chain saw once in a while to half or quarter short pieces of full diameter tree trunks/limbs to be able to get them through my band saw for bowl/spindel/pen blanks. I opted for this rather than purchasing a gas powered model as this essentialy needs no maintenance. Cutting chain was easy to sharpen with only a round diamond file. Saw performs much better than I had anticipated.",
