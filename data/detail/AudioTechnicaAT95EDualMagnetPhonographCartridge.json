      "reviewText": "I needed a new cartridge for my ATLP-120 Turntable so the first option was the atp-2 (which was the cartridge included in the TT), then I was told the ATLP-120 now comes with the AT95E, so after a couple of questions I decided to buy the AT95E, the design is still awful but the sound is crisp and brilliant, it manages the tracking error so good (much better than the ATP-2), I must say that the ATP-2 sounds louder, but louder doesn't mean better, great cartridge. (Thanks for answering my questions)\nKharlos",

I am happy to say it has never sounded so good. I really enjoyed listening to some of my earlier vinyl, and it performed extremely well.",

      "reviewText": "An excellent all around phono cartridge that delivers on value! Clear, resolved definition, particularly in the highs, along with crisp and punchy bass. Jazz dynamics are superb, and blues play with soul and presence. This little cartridge is hard to beat, I doubt there is any competition at this price point.\n\nI have it set at ~2.1g VTF on a Technics SL-D2 and am very pleased with tracking results and sonic performance.\n\nHighly recommended!",
