      "reviewText": "Like the color...but would have liked a gloss finish better than the dull matt. The flag could be a little bit longer. The main issue that we had with it is that it did not \"shut\" unless you really slammed it hard or pushed on it hard. No mail carrier in their right mind would sit there & fidget that much to get it to close so We had to bend the lip some to get it to shut thus the average rating.",
