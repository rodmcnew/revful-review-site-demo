      "reviewText": "I didn't expect to be able to tell a difference when I began taking Move Free Ultra. Things like this rarely work for me. I'm finishing up the first bottle this week and had no plans to purchase more...until yesterday. Going up and down stairs had become very painful for me over the past year or so and I figure I'll eventually have to have knee replacements. Then yesterday, I noticed that I wasn't having pain going up the stairs! I had to take the product for a month before I noticed the improvement, and I have no idea whether I will continue to feel the benefit of taking it, but I purchased a second month's supply today and I'm going to give it a try. I highly recommend Move Free Ultra!",

      "reviewText": "I have been using move free products for about 6 months now and this is the first time I have purchased move free Ultra. I read that the Ultra would work better, but I was skeptical. For such a small pill the move free ultra works a whole lot better on my joints, so well in fact that even my toe and finger knuckles that I used to pop at times (I have never been a fan of popping my knuckles)now don't even pop by accident. Great product!",
