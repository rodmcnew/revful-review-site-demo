      "reviewText": "I honestly have to say that when \"Malcolm in the Middle\" was originally on, I really never watched the show, I watched some of the episodes, but I was in school and didn't have time. Now that I've seen the complete series in re-runs, I must admit I missed out on a fantastic show, I recently purchased \"Malcolm in the Middle\" the complete first season, and it's great, I would recommend this show for anyone who needs a laugh. Let's face it, every family has it's own \"Malcolm\".",
