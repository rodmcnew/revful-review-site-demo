I don't have to use my long nail neither any shape tool to take out some pieces of ice. You just need to touch the bottom of the each ice cube box and the ice popped out like popcorn!!\nThis big size cubes is perfect to freeze beef or chicken broil to make quick and easy cook!! I also use this to freeze chopped fruit and use them when I make smoothies!!\nI purchased three and these item changed my life!!\n\nStrongly recommend!!",
