      "reviewText": "I love this foaming hand soap. I have always disliked how short a period of time foaming hand soaps last. Then, to save money, I always try to refill them by adding some regular soap and water. The bottle will only last a few times after doing that. Not to mention that when you have kids they never refill the bottle! I saw this soap at Walmart and thought, I'll give this a try. I was thinking I could again reuse the bottle and add the cheaper soap to the bottom. What I wasn't expecting is for the bottle to last so long with just the first fill! I have plenty of soap left in the bottom and when it needs to be refilled, it's as simple as squeezing to the line and filling with water. I love it! I will definitely not only be buying more but also buying the refills. What a great product!",

      "reviewText": "So far this item is a win win. Been using foaming soaps for over a decade. Just now tried the CleanPath for the first time. Its better than the others because of the larger, yet not too large, size.\n\nHad to go back and read the web page on how to start it because the print on the bottle was so small, plus I'd already removed the wrapper and thrown it away.\n\nSo, after reading the webpage, I poured the water out, then turned it upside down and squeezed out 1/3 of the blue liquid, then turned it upright, opened the top and added water. It works great, saves money and truely is a great value.",
