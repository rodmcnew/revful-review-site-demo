      "reviewText": "Most of our lawns burn out where they make contact with the asphalt road because the dark road gets so hot in the summer. I cut out 6 inches of my lawn that was next to the road and spread Scotts Turf Builder Heat Tolerant Blue seeds. My lawn is perfect now. My one neighbor who was skeptical that this would work is amazed. His lawn has over 6 inches of dead grass.\n\nWhen I overseed this fall, I am going to use the same Scotts seed.\n\nNick\nHolly Springs, NC",

Last year was my 1st time over seeding in 10 years, wanting the best product for the area this seed did not disappoint. This summer was brutal, but with much needed rain/watering the grass has quickly recovered. I just over seeded this fall and know the results will be outstanding. Forget buying cheap seed pay the extra and enjoy the great results.",
