      "reviewText": "I installed all four T069520 cartridges (new) into my Epson Workforce 610 because I was getting poor color printing. Even with the new cartridges I was still gettng poor color so I checked the online guide which suggested nozzle cleaning. They recommended cleaning (no more than five cleanings) until I got a test page with all the colors. After 3 cleanings the colors were fine but I got a message that the printer was low on ink. The black ink was a third down, the yellow and magenta was down to less than a half, and the cyan was empty. Don't know if this is an ink cartridge problem or a printer problem but contacting Epson was useless.",

My HP wore out and the cheapest available to buy was an Epson, so I bought an Epson. The ink cartridges empty very quickly, and moreover, the ink cartridges are not available abroad. So besides the expensive price, I also have to pay for international shipping, if available at all. Many times, I must pay a re-shipping service because it is against company policy to ship the ink cartridges abroad. It is truly ridiculous. I have never tried the much cheaper compatible cartridges because of mixed reviews, but I can tell you: don't buy an Epson printer unless you want to purchase expensive replacement cartridges several times a year!",
