Set up was a breeze and the touch screen makes it really easy to use. I don't usually go for high tech stuff like this but the price is right and it's definitely worth having if you spend a lot of time in your car. 5 stars!",

      "reviewText": "I finally got a chance to install this. Wiring was pretty simple and straight forward. If you've every put in a stereo, this part is easy.\nI had to trim some of the interior parts of the dash for it to fit since it's bigger than the factory unit. Again no big deal.\nIt worked great for maybe a half hour. Long enough to get most of the settings where I wanted them and the presets done for the radio.\nThen the screen stopped responding to touch and the remote wasn't any use because it never did work.\nI love the ability to use other formats other than the radio and CD's so this would've been great for that. By the time I pulled it out and put the factory unit back in, I was ready to start filling it with bullet holes.\nI'll be returning this and looking for another brand. One that I know will work. I'll never buy this brand again.\nI tried to save money and I got what I paid for.",

Having expandable on deck storage is a great addition to the standard external storage options. The touch screen is great and the interface is easy to navigate. The price is right and itâ€™s a high quality product.",
