So when the Command Strips and Hooks came out, I was extremely happy at how easy they are to put on, and remove!! Thank you for these wonderful hooks and strips!!",

These hooks are awesome for decorating the room and remove easily at the end of the semester. As a teacher, I use them around my classroom as well.",

      "reviewText": "I used these command clips to hang Christmas light (icicles) on the inside window sill and it is the best fit for the job. The clip is 1/2\" W and 3/4\" L, crystal clear, and able to hold two and maybe three 22 AWG cables (my icicles lights have 3 wire intertwined together). Before hanging the clips up, I followed the instruction of cleaning the area with isopropyl rubbing alcohol (not household cleaners), attaching the strips to the clips, applying 30 seconds of pressure to the clip against the wall, and waiting 1 hour before hanging the lights. So far, the lights are hanging up with no issues.\n\nHere are some warnings and notes on the back of package:\n1) Do not use with wallpaper\n2) May not adhere well to vinyl surfaces. Some window cases are made of vinyl.\n3) Do not use for antiques, heirlooms, or other valuable or irreplaceable items\n3) Do not hangs things over beds [There goes my idea of hanging a chandelier over the bed with these :) ]\n4) Use only one hook per item hung\n5) Apply to surfaces above 50F (10C)",

They are very sturdy and well for me with all my holiday decorations. I also hang them around the house to hold my car keys so I can always find them. My teenaged daughter put a few in her locker at school and hung little pencil totes on them. These clips hold up and are great for everyday use.",
