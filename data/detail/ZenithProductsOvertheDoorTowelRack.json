      "reviewText": "I find the plastic coated over the door bath towel holders are better than stainless steel (nickel), also you would think that it would be easier to remove the towel since the bars roll, the bars are not connected or fastened and them rolling off gets annoying. Another problem that I had which is my fault is that I did not look at the measurement of the hook that goes over the door, my door is not wide enough for the hook so the hook sticks out and the hook itself is thick so the door does not close.",

      "reviewText": "This actually made me laugh. Unlike some, I read directions first. It said to get a wrench & a phillips screwdriver--so I did. Then I unpacked the unit. This is held together with the tiniest screw and nut I have ever seen--even in a doll unit. They are so small one can hardly hold them in your fingers and there is no wrench or phillips screwdriver made to fit such things. Oh, I got it put together, but I did a lot of laughing. Not too strong & the hooks for over the door are very thick, so if your door isn't very small for the opening, y ou will not be able to shut your door if you use this.",

However, if you aren't very handy around the house, this may not be the best option for you. Overall, it looks very nice. For $9, you can't beat it. I have the matching over-the-toilet shelf and they look great...especially for the price.",
