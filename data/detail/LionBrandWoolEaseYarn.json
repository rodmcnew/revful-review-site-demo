      "reviewText": "I love this yarn--80% acrylic, 20% wool. The amount of wool gives the finished product a wool look; however, it can be washed and dried in machines and will NOT shrink. Great for baby items, that need to be washed a lot. I have used this yarn for many years and the items I made with it have held up--they look like new, haven't faded or frayed. This yarn is not as available as it used to be in stores; however, I now get it on-line. I am loyal fan of Wool-Ease, worsted weight, Lion Brand Yarn. After spending a lot of time knitting something, I want the item to last and this yarn definitely does.\nSincerely, A joyful knitter",

I have to return the product and then re-buy the merchandise. When I purchased the product on line It was a different price at the store that I was returning it to. It was in there system but they do not carry, plus It was about $10.00 less in the store system? I really like to order on line but hate the hassle of going to customer service for a discount!! Please can you help me? This is the second request on the discount situation!!!",
