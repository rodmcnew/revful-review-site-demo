      "reviewText": "Was intent on purchasing a $40 JVC headphone set; however, the store was out of stock. I purchased instead a $15 Sony behind-the-neck style headphone AND this extension cable. STILL SAVED MONEY! There's no static or snapping (which I was afraid there might be) when using this. I now have 10' of movement to watch TV, DVD's or listed to music without bothering anyone else. What a great save - both $$$ and in familial relationships! LOL",
