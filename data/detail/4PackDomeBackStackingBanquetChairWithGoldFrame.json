      "reviewText": "We were looking for new dining chairs but good quality ones are over $200 a piece. With small children we had to get something that could take a beating. We bought 2 4-packs and store the extra chairs stacked in the garage, it takes very little space. They are tremendouly sturdy, and the pad is super thick and comfortable. For looks, I bought a pattern and I'm making covers with an expensvie-looking material.\nThe chair material is a golden color, not a cream like in the picture.\nWe also used Scotch-Guard on them to keep them looking nice while the covers get sewn.\n\nAll in all, it was an unexpected fantastic buy!",

      "reviewText": "These chairs are great, super sturdy, comfortable, and a great value when compared to anything else for the price and quality. I bought these to replace my kitchen chairs which were rickety and uncomfortable, I also purchased an extra set for my dining room table in order to accommodate company. So glad I made this purchase. Got many compliments on them over the holidays. I had read one other review state that the chair upholstery is really more of a gold color than the picture shows, this is true, but I found this to be an asset as I think it makes them coordinate with any decor.",

      "reviewText": "These chairs are sturdier than you'd guess from the pictures. The color is more golden than the pictures, but very attractive. The value is unbelievable. We really needed chairs for a cool old table we have. I guess we are hard on wooden chairs and we destroy them. Just couldn't find decent ones that would last in our price range. Couldn't afford real expensive ones but feared we would destroy them anyway. These chairs were the best solution I could come up with, even if they were only going to be temporary. However, now that we have used them a few weeks we are in love with them and will be making them our permanent chairs. In fact we might order another set. They are stackable and perfect for bringing out when company comes. You cannot find a better value anywhere else. Probably the best use of money I've experienced in a long time!!!!",
