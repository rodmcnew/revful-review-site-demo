      "reviewText": "This is a great stepper to use at home. Being a red fanatic, I searched all over for a red stepper. When I found this one, I immediately purchased it. I was pleasantly surprised that it arrived much earlier than expected. The product came with two dvd workouts. The first disc is good for beginners to get in the habits of the movements. The second disc definitely gets your blood pumping. I feel fantastic after each set. It's easy and compact to store anywhere. I am very pleased with my purchase.",
