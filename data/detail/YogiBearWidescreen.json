      "reviewText": "I took my 3 year old nephew to the theater to see this movie. He stayed through the whole movie which was something I wasn't expecting. There was nothing \"scary\" in the movie. Even with Disney and Pixar movies there's usually a scary villian, but in this movie there was just a jerky guy who was the villian. Another good thing was there are no annoying songs to get stuck in your head, so watching it over and over wouldn't be too painful. I think I'm going to order this for my nephew's 4th birthday:)",

They just told his story. I loved it. It made me think of my childhood. I also liked the mix of animation and live-action. It was done extremely well. And very realistic.",
