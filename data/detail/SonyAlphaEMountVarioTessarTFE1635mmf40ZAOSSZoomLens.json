      "reviewText": "Great contrast and color, typical of a Zeiss lens. What amazes me is how sharp this lens is at corners, even in the extreme wide angle end (16mm). The distortion is superbly well controlled too.\n\nThe sharpness in the corner indicates that the lens is inherently free of severe distortions, because the interpolation performed to correct the distortion often loses resolution in doing so. Goes to show how much quality optic this lens really is!\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewText": "This is a very nice lens, I can give 9.5 out of 10 for the image quality of this lens, except for one little obvious defect: 90 percent of the area is very sharp except the very edge area has a bit of blur. There are also some distortion on the four corner too, but it's a ultra wide angle lens, and that cannot be avoid. I love this lens' exterior look and its build quality. The price is a bit high compare to sel2470z, probably the devaluation of Canadian dollars played some effect on pricing.",

For landscape great clarity out far and in close manual focus out to 3/4 way very easy on the A7s with aperture selection f/4-22 for great depth clarity.",
