      "reviewText": "I really love Marcy exercise equipment. The brand is very affordable, especially for such a typically expensive piece of equipment. I have a Marcy recumbent bike as well that is still going strong after a year. I have tried many less expensive ellipticals I'm the past, but they were not at all durable and nothing like was advertised. But I definitely recommend this one. I am 5'2 and the stride, set on the shortest distance is perfect for me. I am also very over weight, 250+ and I don't feel like I'm too much for the machine. It's fairly stable, takes a little breaking in at first, but compared to other elliptical for this price, it's ridiculously sturdy. Mine is on carpet though, on a hard floor it would be perfect. Very quiet. Not too difficult to put together if you have ever put a piece of exercise equipment together. Overall, I am incredibly thrilled and would recommend this elliptical to anyone who is larger and trying to lose weight",

      "reviewText": "I purchased this about a week ago, and I am very happy with it. Quality, durability, size is exceptional. I don't have much room, and the overall size for this machine is great. I store/use on hardwood floor and it does not move around at all. I am 5'6 and I do enjoy the stride length of this machine. Toes DO NOT point downward with the pedals, either. I have not heard any noise come from it while in use. I hope this review is helpful for anyone looking to exercise and not spend a ton of $$$ on a machine. This does the trick!",
