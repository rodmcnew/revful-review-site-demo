      "reviewText": "These stools are beautiful!! They look perfect by our island. Great quality, a little difficult to put together and needed some longer screws. The high backs make them comfortable and give them a grand look, yet they are still rustic enough to go with the rest of our decor due to the burnished black color. Shipped site to store for free, easy to pick up!",

In fact one needs to have patience to put such packaged items together and read the instructions first. All the parts were there and put together everything in a few. Another person would be helpful to hold it while putting leg supports together.\n\nVery nice and elegant looking with a beautiful design and spacious feeling. Goes well with the table that requires these.",

The instructions were hard to follow at first but I assembled them the next day with no problems. It came with an Allen wrench so I didn't need any additional tools. They are solid wood and very sturdy.",
