      "reviewText": "I'm still exploring the uses for my new Label Printer. The Ribbons I printed made nice additions for my Christmas gifts this year. I have so many different ideas for gifts and more that I can use the printed ribbons. I am open to all kinds of ideas for labeling my hand made items to personalized ribbons for little girls hair. I just wish the ribbon cartridges were more readily available than having to order from Epson. I also like that I can use the label maker for iron on labels and labels for my home office all in one great labelmaker.",
