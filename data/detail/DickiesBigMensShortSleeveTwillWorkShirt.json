      "reviewText": "I bought these shirts 7 years ago for my husband who work in construction. I have to say they have outlasted any other pieces of clothing he has worn including his off work clothes. I am just now replacing them but not because they are wore out but because 7 years of washing has finally faded them a little. He would never wear another workshirt.",

This Dickies brick red shirt was just what I was looking for. A nice heavy material that looks good after drying it on the line. I expect it to last for years. Very happy with the purchase!",

He always comes home filthy, and his clothes really take a beating, but these stand up to it! I purchased the first set at least 10 months ago and they are still in pretty good shape. I was so satisfied I am not even considering trying different brands. They are also available in a variety of colors and with long sleeves.",
