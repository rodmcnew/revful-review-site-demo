      "reviewText": "I was looking for a replacement antenna since the one I had broke where the plug went into the radio. This one looked a bit more sturdy than the original ones that Sirius supply with theirs. This one is a bit more solid and looks like it will tolerate a bit more abuse as I move mine from truck to truck. The picture that is shown of the plug end is not very good, but it does fit your standard XM/Sirius radio. Time will tell",

      "reviewText": "When I sold a car I kept my Onyx EZ radio. However I didn't want to take the time to carefully remove panels where I had hid the antenna wire. Simply cutting the wire saved me a couple of hours, but this meant buying a new antenna.\n\nThis antenna fit perfectly and the wire is thicker - not too thick, which would make concealment hard, but more robust.\n\nMore importantly reception was as good or better than original.",
