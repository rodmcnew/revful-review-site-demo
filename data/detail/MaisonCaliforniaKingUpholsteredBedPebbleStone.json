      "reviewText": "Ever order something fully expecting that you will not like it, but the price is so great that you have to give it a try? Then it turns out that it is pretty awesome? That's what happened for me with this bed.\n\nI had been searching for an upholstered bed for weeks without any luck. Then I came on to Walmart's website to order a metal frame to use until I finally found/made what I wanted because my new California King bed was due to be delivered in less than a week. In the little, \"you may also like\" section, this little gem appears. On a whim, I bought it and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe quality isn't top of the line by any means, but it is very sturdy and the fabric is a good quality. It looks far more expensive than the $300 I paid for it.\n\nThe assembly was easily handled and the parts went together as they should without any issues. It does take two people (or one really coordinated person) to assemble.\n\nShipping was free, but I opted for the quicker shipping (~$3 extra). The boxes (there are two) arrived two days early and in great condition. Nothing was damaged inside.\n\nThe downsides: the headboard isn't very tall and could be more up-to-date. The headboard construction is the only questionable part of the construction on the bed for me because it's two pieces held together with four bolts.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this bed to anyone. Great value for the price.",

      "reviewText": "I was hesitant when ordering this bed because of the price. I had been looking for a new bed for some time but all of the beds that I liked were anywhere from $899-$2,300 so when I saw this bed on Walmart.com for $299.00 I assumed it was going to be poorly made; however, I figured site to store is free shipping and returns to the store are free so I gave it a go.\n\nThe bed shipped and arrived in the store one week after ordering it. This bed exceeded my expectations, was easy to put together, and looks fantastic in our bedroom! We have both our box spring and our mattress on this bed and although it makes the bed super high, I love the lux feeling to it; however, I am sure you can get away with just a mattress on this bed.\n\nA friend came over the day after we put the bed together and she did not believe me when I told her that it was $299.00 from Walmart; she swore she saw it at Restoration Hardware. I highly recommend this bed!",
