Also, to me, they keys are slightly \"loose\" feeling, but this keyboard does in fact feel good when typing and is a good keyboard for daily constant use.",

But....it's no different from what I'm currently using. It's a really good value and if one simply needs to replace what they're using, it should be be fine for them. I, however, returned mine cause it just wasn't what I'm looking for.",
