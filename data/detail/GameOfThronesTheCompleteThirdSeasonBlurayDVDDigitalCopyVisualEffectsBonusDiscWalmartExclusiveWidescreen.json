      "reviewText": "Just as intense and electrifying as ever, but honestly, what were you expecting... It's Game of Thrones. Just like Seasons 1 & 2 before it, this Season is no different, delivering AAA quality and acting. It would be best not to think of this as a TV series and more of a 10 hour long movie that you physically won't be able to stop watching. Filled with mind-blowing plot twists and surprises, you will be helplessly glued to the edge of your seat as you are immersed into the vibrant and unforgiving world of Game of Thrones. It is an emotionally driven, human drama that, despite having essential elements of fantasy, is a very real and believable experience. It will take you across the entire spectrum of human emotion and stretch every single one to the breaking point as no show has done before. The replay value of this Series as a whole is definitively unparalleled.\n\nNo spoilers here, but I only hope that the show does not stray too far from it's source material... Let's just say that when George R.R. Martin decides whether a character should live or die, there is usually, no, ALWAYS a reason. Especially when it concerns such an important one. And if you have read his phenomenal book series this is based on, A Song of Ice and Fire, you will undoubtedly lose your mind at a particularly infamous scene...",
