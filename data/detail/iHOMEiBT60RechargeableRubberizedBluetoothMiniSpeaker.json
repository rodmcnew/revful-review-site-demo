      "reviewText": "This speaker has fantastic sound for something so little! We bought two for our daughter. They came charged. One speaker has adequate volume for a 12' x 15' room. It took a minute or two for Bluetooth to sync up between her cell phone and the speaker, but it worked fine and played with her cell 25' away. (The instructions say it has a 30' Bluetooth range.) She wasn't able to sync both speakers to her phone at once (only one at a time works with Bluetooth). She hasn't tried linking the two via a cable. There is no volume control on the speaker, but that isn't an issue for our daughter. I researched a lot of these portable speakers and believe we got our money's worth paying regular price although it would have been even nicer to get them on sale.",
