      "reviewText": "I bought this movie on Blu-Ray for my husbands Birthday. We already own the original DVD, and since it was one of his favorites; thought he would love the upgrade to Blu-Ray.\nWe were kinda shocked that the picture still had a grain quality to it, this has not been the case with other favorites that have been upgraded. We learned that Fox, the company who distributes this movie slacks on their Blu-Ray transfers, maybe they favored HDDVD? Buyer Beware of older titles on Blu-Ray that are distributed by Fox.",

      "reviewText": "I was turned on to \"The Transporter\" series by a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.\nIn classic Transporter stryle, there are high speed car chases with amazing driving and fantastic fight scenes. Perhaps best of all, Frank (Jason Statham) does it all with tremendous style.\n\nMy favorite is #2, followed by #3 and then #1.\nI own all three and enjoy watching them.\nI hope they keep the momentum going with a Transporter 4 and beyond. In my mind, this could easily be a James Bond like series...",
