I think this series can continue for a long time just like the Stephanie Plum series. I for one am looking forward to the next one.",

      "reviewText": "I really enjoyed reading this book. I love Janet and her Stephanie Plum series. I love Lizzy's character and the way she thinks as well as her cooking really delicious cupcakes and food. I feel there are similarities between her Plum series and her Lizzy & Diesel series. With this book, the two main male characters remind me of in the Plum series, Ranger and Morelli. I really love how Janet writes and the way she portrays characters. I enjoy her writing style and although this book was full of content I wasn't familiar with, I still really enjoyed this book. Definitely a good read :)",
