      "reviewText": "I bought this to improve airflow after upgrading my graphics card. For the price you cannot beat this case. The only thing keeping my review from 5 stars is the lack of a second cooling fan. However, I found a 120mm secondary fan online for $10 that had a red LED to match the built in rear fan. My computer runs cooler than ever and the case is very stylish.",

      "reviewText": "This is the best case that I have ever used for a build and I have been building computers for almost 20 years. There are a lot of locations to put fans. All the red area at the front of the case is perforated for air flow. I used a clear lighted power supply that looks great. There is a location at the bottom of the case where you can attach a SSD 2.5 inch drive so you don't need an adapter. There is plenty spaces for 3.5 inch and 5.25 inch drives with one screwless adapter for each size. There is a USB 3.0 plug going to the front panel, so you might consider using a motherboard that has a jack for that plug. This case is way more worth what you pay for it. I put an AMD A8 CPU in it since it is branded for an AMD. Very cool looking. Buy it.",
