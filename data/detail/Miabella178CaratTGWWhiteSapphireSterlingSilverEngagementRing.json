      "reviewText": "I recently lost my actual first engagement ring at work in a retail store. It was real and I had it for almost 2 years. After losing it most a week ago, I went on the search for a very special and expensive (looking ring). I will be wearing this ring for the next 3 months until we get married. (Perfect replacement!) When looking at the ring really hard, you can tell that it is not a real diamonds \"hands down\". But the ring actually takes some getting use to, \"if you are a girl who is use to the real deal in jewelry.\" I took quite a few photos wearing the ring, and it looks very amazing and the detail is so beautiful! If someone is looking at the ring from a distance they will be captivated by how expensive it looks. I wore it in the shower and it never slipped off and while washing dishes. The carat in the middle of it is not foggy at all. It looks so romantic and my fiancee loves how realistic it looks. It is worth the buy ladies the photos are not edited in no way possible.",

Since buying my ring I have had many compliments on it and when I tell people how reasonable it was they can't believe it. I would highly recommend this ring.",
