      "reviewText": "The mounting system/brackets that come standard with SiruisXM radios are poor at best. After shopping around and only coming up with outrageously priced brackets I located the Arkon 8.5\" Radio Mount. IT WORKS PERFECTLY and it is relatively inexpensive. The \"gooseneck\" itself is a little tight/stiff, other than that I can't think of anything wrong with this product.",

The piece that attaches to the back of the radio, however, does not match the back of my radio. I'm going to have to modify it. Maybe the manufacturer could modify it or include a few different pieces.",
