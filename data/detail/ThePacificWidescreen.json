While engaged with \"Company of Heroes\" I was able to watch the corresponding \" Band of Brothers\". Now that I am currently involved in the Pacific with \"Pacific War\" the mini series \"Pacific was made to order. I would reccoment this product to all persons of similair interests.",

Recommend watching the 6th disc first with profiles of the different people portrayed in the series. Also on each disc you can choose to watch it with historical background.",
