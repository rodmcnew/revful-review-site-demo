I love adding a little extra boost of flavor without the calories to my morning/afternoon coffee. Vanilla has been a big hit with my family and friends. It's just want I need to get me through a crazy day at work. If you're looking for a boost of flavor that you control, then I would recommend this vanilla goodness :)",

      "reviewText": "I received samples of Folgers Flavors Coffee Enhancers from Crowdtap to taste and review. What a find! These palm-sized squeeze bottles are simply divine! No refrigeration needed. No calories or carbs. Best of all, you can use them at home or on-the-go! Put them in your purse, car or even your desk drawer. Anywhere you go, you can always have that perfect\ncustomized coffee.\n\nAdding Vanilla to my coffee is just an enjoyable experience. It is creamy tasting without the cream and sweet. Vanilla enhances the coffee for a delightful taste.\n\nAll the flavors are delicious! #FolgersFans #sponsored",

      "reviewText": "I was so excited to find the Folgers Flavors in our coffee aisle that I purchased the three flavors that I commonly get at coffee shops. Vanilla, caramel, and mocha. I was very disappointed in all three. They have a bitter/alcohol/metallic taste that it made the coffee undrinkable. I wish I had only purchased one and tried it before I got all three. So disappointed.",
