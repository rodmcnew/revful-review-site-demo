      "reviewText": "Yeah, I know, pretentious overweening title for a review of an animated series, but bear with me. This show has more tragedy, better characters, and clever dialogue than 90% of what you'd television today or yesterday. The show has powerful themes of love, loss, and treachery across its entire run. Along with great animation and great villains it is shameful the show wasn't finished (3rd season doesn't count) and the moral guardians had to butt in to ruin what drama might have been greater with their ridiculous bans on things like guns and punching (why, exactly, they never came down so hard on, say, Batman TAS or Power Rangers-which was imitable violence I will never know).\n\nThis series is also a great way of introducing the younger set to Shakespeare.",

It came in quicker than I thought, and was able to relive my childhood again! Even my husband enjoyed it. The discs were of good quality, no scratches. Played wonderful on my PS3. If you are a fan of the show, you won't be disappointed!",
