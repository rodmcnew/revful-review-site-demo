      "reviewText": "The Fullmetal Alchemist series is quite simply a work of art. Visually stunning and emotionally wrenching, with an exquisite soundtrack, a plot that never disappoints or becomes predictable, and seamless character development. It transcends the anime genre and attaches itself to your heart, because it's not just about the Elric brothers' quest, it's about human nature and our search for ourselves. It is every bit as addictive and rich as the Harry Potter series, but is even more gorgeous on every level. This is one of the few shows I've seen rated everywhere with high acclaim, and now that I've watched it I can say that it is an experience that everyone should have who enjoys having a thing of beauty in their lives just for its own sake.",
