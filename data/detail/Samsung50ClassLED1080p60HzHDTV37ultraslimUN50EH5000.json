      "reviewText": "Besides the stupid off on manual button, it is like a gaming toggle on a ps3 or 360 controller this TV met and exceeded all expectations. First off, I up until this point I have went through TWELVE new TVs in six months and after 45 days with this HOPEFULLY I am finished. You ask why did I go through twelve, BECAUSE I am ULTRA picky. Second off, NEW Bravias are junk. Third, there is NO perfect TV including this one. Now the great things about this TV. I bought it for 678.00 with employee discount. I am a big defective pixel guy and this one HAS NONE. Which is a miracle with what I have went through. A big defect with this TV is the fact when you use the manual button it shakes the TV which can not be good for it. I am buying an extra remote off of Amazon as soon as the 90 day return policy is over. Do not be bought into the smart tv craze. It makes the Tv more expensive and you will not use it. I consider myself an expert so take this advice. The best TVs in the world are Panasonic plasmas so buy those if your not in a hurry to game. If you have over a grand to buy a large tv buy the silver rimmed Samsungs. If not buy Panay plasmas or these series Samsungs. If your broke buy Phillips, Emerson or Magnavox. Here is some noted advice. If you are a gamer you have to run this thing in game mode AND shut off DNR to reduce game lag.",

      "reviewText": "I consider this an exceptional step up from my Sony Bravia LCD this replaced. This thing excels in bright rooms and is crystal clear. What can I say, it is a great LED and there are so many picture tweaks nearly any viewer will be able to dial in a great display for their application.\n\nIt 100% meets my expectations. I guess it's so good it shows you faults you may have never noticed. That being said, plasma is still the king of picture quality for movies. The black reproduction at night is still subject to LCD construction resulting in less black than a plasma. Think of it like a flashlight behind a black sheet where plasma looks like the individual pixels can completely shut off to give you the deepest blacks.\n\nThis LED worked great for my bright living room and I prefer to not have the temporary burn in of plasmas when I use it with my laptop and PS3. I would recommend plasma for movie lovers in a dark room. LED for everything else (computer display, gaming display, bright room, dim room) and that is why I picked this TV and it does everything mostly very well.\n\nBy the way, the previous reviewer stated the power button on the set wasn't the best designed. I agree, but I would like to state that in my opinion that the button is not so bad as to not choose this TV.\n\nI would not value a 120hz, 240hz or 600hz set to be any smoother than this one. 99% of films are shot in 24 fps then converted to display at 60hz. So there is no need to get 120hz. The other 1% are experimenting with 48 frames per second so until that technology is surpassed there is really no need for having 120hz. My Sony was 120hz and I can not tell a difference and actually the ESPN scrolling text seems smoother on this Samsung.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my review, it is by no means complete. I don't use the TV's speakers, I only use one HDMI on the TV, etc. Trying not to be long winded, I love this TV!! Buy it!\n\nMy settings:\nMode: Movie\nBacklight 17\nContrast: 95\nBrightness: 45\nSharpness: 35\nColor: 50\nColor Space: Auto\nDynamic Contrast: Off\nBlack Tone: Dark\nFlesh: 0\nColor Tone: Warm1\nDigital Noise Filter: Auto\nHDMI Black Level: Low\nLED Motion Plus: Off",

The Toshiba served me well, no breakdowns ever and 15 years of service and still has a great picture but, I wanted HDTV.\n\nThis is a great treat for me. It is fabulous. Certainly easy on old eyes. The picture is totally like going to the movie theater. This is a 49.5\" flat screen. Big enough for me to see the menu. I think it is fabulous. It has many features I haven't had time to explore yet. I also purchased the 4 year warranted policy. this registered.\n\nCan't wait to see the Olympics!!!",
