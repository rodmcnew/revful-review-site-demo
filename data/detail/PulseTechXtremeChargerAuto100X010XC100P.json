      "reviewText": "My Volvo's battery wouldn't charge to 100% and my Vector Smart Battery Charger kept dropping out with an error code before fully charged. So I bought the Pulse Tech Xtreme to give it a try. At first it would only charge to 75%. I decided to leave it on over night. When I came out in the morning the battery was charged to 100%. Apparently, the desulfating pulses cleared up the batteries problem and it now charges fully.\nLooks like a well built, simple to use battery charger. Nicer than any other charger I've had over the years.",

I'm using it to charge an old jeep battery. I have left it connected for several days and the battery is now consistantly at 100% charge.",

      "reviewText": "Pros: So far, they do seem to be prolonging lead acid flooded cell batteries and sealed lead acid (manufacturer doesn't say the exact type) battery's life. So over time, these will save you money. I have two of these and one of their two station units.\n\nCons: The green LEDs are so difficult to see in some lighting situations, it's ridiculous. They are difficult to see, in particular when looking at the units at an angle in normal lighting situations and therefore it can be hard to tell what's going on concerning the operation. In bright light, it is basically impossible to see the green LEDs. I have never used equipment with LEDs that are this difficult to see and I have used various test equipment, repaired and used various equipment in manufacturing and in hospitals. The manufacturer stated something to the effect that the LEDs' brightness is according to industrial standards. I know of no such standard. Some of the units have failed and it took longer than expected to receive replacements. So far, the last ones I've received are still working okay.",
