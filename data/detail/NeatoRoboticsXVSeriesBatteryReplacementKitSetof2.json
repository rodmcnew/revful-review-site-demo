      "reviewText": "Our Neato had gotten where it would only clean for about 10 minutes before it would shut down due to a low battery. At times, it would lock-up and would not charge without hooking it up to our lap top to get it to wake up. The batteries are the life of these machines and once the batteries get where they will not hold a charge the Neato will not perform. Don't buy cheap aftermarket batteries, stay with the factory ones for the best battery life. New batteries will make your Neato perform like when it was new. Worth the money although like most consumers I wish these were in the $30 price range.",
