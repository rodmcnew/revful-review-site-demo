      "reviewText": "I live in a Virginia Beach and I love this grass seed, unfortunately Scotts has a problem with the labeling (and in my mind the Name of the Starter Fertilizer.\nHere is the label from the Scotts® Turf Builder® Heat-Tolerant Blue Mix\n\"4. CARE\nSeed will begin to grow in 6-10 days. You can mow the seedlings when they reach 3 inches in height. \"Apply Scotts® Turf Builder® Starter Food for New Grass 2-4 weeks after seeding.\" Do not apply a weed control product until after at least three mowings.\"\n\nHere is the label from the Scotts® Starter® Food for New Grass Plus Weed Preventer\n\"When to Apply\nApply on a calm day. Apply this product before watering newly planted grass for the first time. Apply when temperatures are consistently between 60°F and 90°F.\"\n\nEasy enough to see that the directions on the Grass Seed conflict with the directions on the \"Starter\" Fertilizer and, as I did last year or a 50/50 pick, you can make a mistake and believe that the \"Starter\" Fertilizer is right which means you will have no new grass, or you can believe that the Grass Seed is right and hopefully everything will go as planned.\n\nThe Scotts® Starter® Food for New Grass Plus Weed Preventer should not be named a \"Starter\" fertilizer as it is plainly not, but a \"New Grass\" fertilizer. Words have meaning.",

      "reviewText": "I live on a busy Interstate access road and have always had trouble keeping the devil-strip (tree lawn) green due to the excessive heat along the road. I always use Scotts products and decided to try this Scotts® Turf Builder® Heat-Tolerant Blue Mix when replanting this troublesome area in the fall of 2010. WOW! It came in great and has been beautiful for the last two summers. This summer (2012) really put it to the test with the high heat and drought conditions. It survived with minimal watering and now that the rain has returned looks fantastic again. I plan on using this for reseeding the areas of my yard that were damaged by the severe heat this summer. I know it will look great.",

      "reviewText": "We live in Southern Illinois and had been using the Scott's year-round fertilizer program for 3 years. I'll admit, we skimped out and bought another brand of grass seed for the first two years. Last year, after aerating our lawn in September, we over-seeded with Scott's Heat Tolerant Mix. What a difference it made! This spring, we had great growth the density of the lawn was visibly noticeable. The grass is healthy and doesn't take much water or care - which means lower water bills and more time to enjoy the lawn!",
