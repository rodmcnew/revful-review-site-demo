      "reviewText": "Ok finally found a jean that fits me fairly well. I am 51 years old, 5'3 and have a big tummy. I have to try on at least 5-6 pairs of jeans before finding a pair that works for my proportions. Since I am shorter, I need short length ( they call them petite here) I am not truly a petite in other clothing tho. I love the darker washes and this is the lightest color I will wear. They feel great, wash well and seem to hold their color and style. The price is the best! They stay up where they belong. I have tried jeans from the \"fancy big girl\" store and they are just too low cut. I am always trying to pull up the jeans that are cut to stay down! So glad these are around and affordable!",

I'm used to wearing Talbot's jeans ($90 and up) but needed to replace some of my clothes since I've lost a bit of weight and can't pay that kind of money any more. These Just My Size jeans are great. They've got just a bit of stretch.They're comfortable and made well. I just wish there was a greater color selection.",

      "reviewText": "This is more a comment about the manufacturer rather than Walmart. I am very short and whenever I can find them, I purchase petite plus-size jeans. Normally, I don't have a problem with the waist size, but the length of the inseam is always too long, by about four to six inches. I don't mind a little extra length, but when I have to take four inches off the cuff because they are too long, it gets old really fast. Other than that issue, they are comfortable, and fit in the waist and hips.",
