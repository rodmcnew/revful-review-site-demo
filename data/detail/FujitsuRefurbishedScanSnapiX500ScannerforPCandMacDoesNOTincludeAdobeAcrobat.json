      "reviewText": "I was contemplating buying the Neat Scanner but after looking at all the features of the Scan Snap iX500 Scanner I had to give it a try. Believe me, I was not disappointed.\n\nIf I had to described the Scan Snap iX500 Scanner by Fujitsu in one word it would be \"Extraordinary\". With his blazing's fast speed I can scan 25 pages, both sides of the document in less than a minute with just one touch of the button. Now how amazing is that?\n\nNot to mention, I thought it was going to take 10-14 days and I received it in about 5 days.",
