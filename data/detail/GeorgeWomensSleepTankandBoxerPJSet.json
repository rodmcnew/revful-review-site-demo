They are super soft and the buttons down the center help separate my breasts while sleeping. I am buying a couple more sets and I would definitely recommend these.",

      "reviewText": "First of all this item would have a solid 5 star average if the one person who wrote a great review didn't accidently mark it as one star rating. Very comfy, soft and non constricting. True to size if you have huge breasts that touch the skin on your rib cage you can always hike the shorts up under your chest so it doesn't touch the skin like that and in doing this it won't give you a frontal weggie LOL. But holy geeze, is this a great sleep set. Perfect for hot California nights",

      "reviewText": "I purchased two sets of these PJs at the store and absolutely love them. The fabric is so soft, that I can't wait to put them on & don't want to take them off. The style & cut are very flattering. I have joint injuries and am overweight. The majority of my weight is around my midsection, and these PJs hang nicely, so you don't notice my big stomach. Perfect summer PJ's and at a great price.",
