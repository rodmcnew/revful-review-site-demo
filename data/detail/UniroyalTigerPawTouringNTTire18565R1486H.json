      "reviewText": "I purchased 4 tires to replace Michelin tires which had met their milage warranty. These tires were rated highly and have exceeded my expectations regarding comfort and traction in snow. We do a lot of interstate driving at high speed, with a lot of secondary road travel, the tires have felt firm and handled perfectly. I would recommend them for people, encountering snow and rain issues, looking for a great value.",

Great value! I paid $103 per tire which compares very favorably with other tires that I was considering (Goodyear, Yokohama, Continental, Michelin etc) which ranged from $150 to $250.",

      "reviewText": "I bought a set of these excellent tires and had them replace the Goodyears on our Chrysler mini van four years ago. We then sold the van to our neighbor when we bought a Nissan Cube. The Cube's stock Toyo tires wore fast and were too thin to make it through this winter so we purchased another set of Tiger Paws after seeing the tread left on the tires my neighbor's mini van. I feel a positive effect and could tell a difference in the way the car handled immediately.\n\nThis tire is a durable all season performer of great value.",
