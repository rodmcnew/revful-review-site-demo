It's a really good deal, and has a really good flavor. Not too stong and never gives me heartburn like monster or red bull.",

Full Throttle has a good taste that doesn't get old as quickly as most other energy drinks. The only problem is that these 12 oz cans don't provide quite enough drink to last for a whole day, so I got through them much quicker than expected.",
