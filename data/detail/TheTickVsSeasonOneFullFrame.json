      "reviewText": "When Ben Edlund's brainchild, The Tick, finally appeared on the small screen, it was a hit with both viewers and critics alike. Laced with clever humor, this show is a reasonably faithful screen adaptation of the original comics. Although meant to be a spoof of mainstream comics books (e.g. the character in the Episode, \"The Tick vs. The Tick\", called Big Shot is obviously meant to parody Marvel's The Punisher, one of my all-time favorite comic book lines, especially those written by Garth Ennis), one does not need to be a comic book fan to appreciate the humor, which should appeal to both children and adults alike. Furthermore, unlike most modern cartoons (which are designed to foist product lines upon impressionable young minds), there is a subtle layer of depth not seen in such monotonous violence-driven fare. The reference to the ancient Greek classic, The Ilead, in the episode, \"The Tick vs. Arthur's Bank Account\" is a good example of this. While most children will find appeal in the physical comedy, some may share the adult appreciation of such references, as well as the references to irresponsible credit-based spending (much more appreciated these days) or the trend to \"modern\" parenting techniques which often defy common sense. A few children may actually be enlightened, even if only by accident, which should be one of the defining characteristics of an enduring cartoon classic.",
