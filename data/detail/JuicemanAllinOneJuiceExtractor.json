      "reviewText": "I am quite happy with this purchase. The juicer is well-constructed, juices efficiently, and is relatively easy to clean. The blade/filter always takes a little added effort, to clean out the little pinholes, but is no real problem.\n\nA certain consumer ratings magazine ranked this as their first choice, over models that cost a lot more. The \"Juiceman\" knew what he was doing when he put his name on this device.\n\nI heartily recommend it.",
