      "reviewText": "I'm new to the kinect and bought this game because my 3 year old son LOVES cars and toy story and owns incredibles, ratatouille and up on DVD! My fiance and I both love playing it with our son and seeing his face light up when we turn it on, is well worth the money! Even though he's only 3, he can pretty much do everything in the game(so far) He drove the cars with no problem, ran with woody, chased the house from UP, and jumped over electric bars with the incredibles! The racing is definitely his favorite... if his little arms didnt hurt from holding them up for too long, he would play it all day long and never stop. On top of that, chasing the UP house made me sweat... and playing Incredibles made my fiance sweat! HAHA! So what could be better than burning some calories while enjoying play time with your kid? :) It's great fun and I would buy it again and again and again!",

      "reviewText": "My son had got this game last Christmas I was a little worried sense he was only 3, but he loved it! This game is awesome for any age!! you make your character in the beginning but can change it anytime you can choose default or have the Kinect make one that looks like you, auto saves which that is always nice, easy to play, easy moves, great for little ones sense they cant fail the level, even after the level is complete they give you more goals to meet, extra missions,extra buddies to help you ect. so you can keep playing the same game for awhile even after you beat it to get extra stuff. great two player game you have to help each other aka be a team the whole time which is fun. Have had no problems with the game. One of our favorite Kinect games!! would recommend this game to anybody.",

It's a little touchy at times trying to start in the beginning and there are a few obstacles he has trouble with, but overall, I would recommend it for someone looking for a game for young children. My 3 kids are ages 4-10 and they ALL love playing it...even together!",

You can drop in or out, and it pauses if you leave the game area. He can maneuver all of the menus himself. Great game for little ones, and the price was great too.",
