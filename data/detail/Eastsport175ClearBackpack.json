      "reviewText": "We bought this for our son whose school only allows clear backpacks these days..... They were impossible to find in stores anywhere! So I looked on Walmart's website and found them! I really didn't expect much, figured they'd tear quickly with heavy books, etc., in there, so I ordered two just in case they weren't available later when the first one did rip. But much to my surprise, they are much stronger than I expected and the vinyl is softer, not brittle so won't puncture so easily. I almost bought four to be sure he has a backpack the whole year but decided to wait until I got the first ones to see if that would be necessary, I don't think it will be. I really think one, or at least the two of them will last the whole school year. By the way, my son is 12 and in the 7th grade. So no HUGE text books yet....",

I was even happier when it arrived fairly quickly and was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, the DAY AFTER I opened it and used it, the zipper for the smaller front pocket broke; it comes apart and won't stay closed even after I have zipped it. I only had a few pens and a pocket notebook in there so it was by no means even remotely full. There is no reason that it should have come apart that way. Other than that it works well it is just really disappointing because (even though it was cheap) I had literally only zipped it twice.",
