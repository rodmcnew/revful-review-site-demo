The quality of workmanship was on par with what I've seen in jewelry stores. I ended up returning the rings because they made my ring too wide for my finger, but the rings were beautiful with no issues.",

Only complaint is when the band moved around the tiny diamonds and studs rub adjoining fingers. I'm sure I will get used to it the more I wear it.",
