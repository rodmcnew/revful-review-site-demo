      "reviewText": "Just installed 10 days ago so can't say how long it will hold up. But its a PERFECT fit for a defunct antec AR-350 and the size was top priority. And it has 50 more watts. Price was excellent and I had it shipped to store so no cost. If it holds up for 6 more months, it will have been worth it for me. Anything more is just icing.",
