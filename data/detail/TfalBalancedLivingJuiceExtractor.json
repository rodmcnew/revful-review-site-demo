      "reviewText": "I didn't get this from Walmart but I wanted to review this awesome juicer! When everything is assembled, you'll need quite a bit of counter space. I use it on my island. It juices fast and I love how it has the little attachment inside the pitcher that catches all the foam. I've put in whole carrots, apples with peel, core and all, and spinach. Everything goes through just fine. Taking apart everything to wash is a breeze and it's nice that I can just throw it in the dishwasher. I have hand washed everything and it really takes no time at all. Mine was discounted about 25% but I would definitely buy it full price knowing how well it works. There is one con, but it doesn't really bother me. The \"no drip spout\" does drip so I would suggest placing a small towel underneath your juicer when in use. I have granite counter tops and anything and everything ruins them! Definitely a must buy if you're into or curious about juicing. This product is sturdy and works well. I don't see myself having to replace it anytime soon.",

It is fast, cleans up quickly (10 minutes or less depending on what you put in it), and it provides a lot of juice. For the price it was the perfect juicer to start with.",
