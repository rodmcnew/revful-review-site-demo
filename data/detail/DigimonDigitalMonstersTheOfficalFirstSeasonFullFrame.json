      "reviewText": "Digimon Season 1 is among the best in animated cartoon series. For those with an inclination toward science fiction and quality characterization, Digimon won't disappoint. I still find honesty and value in its presentation of the story and I'm now in my mid-twenties. Walmart's price is exceptionally reasonable, so grab it if you can! There are a few small quality issues with the product (line shadowing on the screen in a few episodes; some mix-ups in the printed booklet accompanying the discs). However, this detracts very little. Highly recommended for your collecton and viewing pleasure!",

      "reviewText": "I bought this DVD when it was half of what it would normally cost. I was going to get it for Xmas but I decided to go ahead and buy it now. The video and audio quality is great and there seems to be no problems with it. For 8 disks and 54 episodes this is not a bad deal at all. It helped me remember a time when things were simpler and my only concern was what would Angemon's digivolution look like. The only thing I wish it had was more bonus features.",
