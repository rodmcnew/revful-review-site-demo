      "reviewText": "I am 64 years old and my teeth are sensitive. When I use Sensodyne, I am able to eat everything from ice cream to hot tamales. It wasn't always that way. Other toothpaste simply cleaned my teeth. Sensodine, as I was told by my dentist, coats sensitive areas of my mouth and fills tiny lines that cause me discomfort. I highly recommend Sensodyne. Even for the higher price it is an exceptional deal.",
