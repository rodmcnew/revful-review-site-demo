      "reviewText": "If you own a 5.4L 3 valve V-8, you must use this filter! Motorcraft has a pattented designed check valve inside this filter that other manufacturers cannot copy until the pattent runs out. The check valve keeps oil around the phasers and rocker arms for cold starts. If this oil isn't there, damage will occur to the phasers which will evetually lead to a complete engine failure. If your engine is already making a diesel sound, then damage has already occurred. The repair to mine cost me $2600 at my local dealership. This is a well known problem at the Ford truck forums on-line. Ford should make it known to the owners, but there making too much money to want to change it.",
