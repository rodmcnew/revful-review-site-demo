      "reviewText": "This review includes seasons 5 through 7. I enjoyed X Files. For the most part, each episode stood alone. As a result, there was story completion without interruption.\n\nThe series resembled the 1958 Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer and 1974 Kolchak - The Night Stalker television series staring Darrin McGavin.\n\nActing, scripts, and music were better than the majority of broadcast television drama today.\n\nIn addition, DVD picture quality was good but nothing to brag about. However, many of the indoor scenes were overly dark. I suppose darkness was intended for scary atmosphere purposes.\n\nOverall, the product was worth its price.",
