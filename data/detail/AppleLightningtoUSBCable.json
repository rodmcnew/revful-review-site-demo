It worked fine for the first couple of weeks then all the sudden it decided when it was going to work. It finally broke after only having it for a month. What kind of specialty charger dies after only a month? I ended up buying a cheaper one from Walgreens and its excellent after 4 months of use.",

      "reviewText": "I can understand why Apple needed to improve the connector on my iPhone 5 and new iPad. It works great and is reversible, which is convenient. But I've got six or seven devices, including the iPhone connector built into my car, clock radio dock, etc., that use the old connector. It's a shame to pay $19.95 to $29.95 for adapters/cables, especially since I've had to buy five of them. But they do work well.",
