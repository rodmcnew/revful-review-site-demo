      "reviewText": "This system is easy to use and install. I installed the whole system with 2 cameras in minutes, I attached the cameras to my stucco walls outside under my eaves. I just linked the cameras to the monitor, mounted and plugged them into the power (Done)! One camera watches the front door area and the other my driveway. All necessary mounting equipment came with the system.\nThe cameras transmit 30 & 40 feet to the monitor which sits next to my chair, they are clear and have decent color in the day. The night vision is very good for the money, it's better than my Q-see camera system which cost more.\nThe sound is the best! I'm listening to birds chirp right now and I enjoy being able to speak to someone outside, it really annoys my wife~ when she arrives the system alarm tells me and I welcome her home from either camera and my voice is clear through the system. Also, it's very intimidating to be talked to through a surveillance system when you approach someone's home.\n(What I would change) The SD card needs to be removed to watch the videos` I would like to watch the on the monitor. It's a bit slow moving between cameras manually. Only one camera will record at a time, this is bad when the object being recorded moves between the cameras.",
