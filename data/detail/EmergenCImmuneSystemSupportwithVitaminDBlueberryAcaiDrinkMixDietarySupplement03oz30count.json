My only disappointment is that it is not readily available at any of the stores close by where I live. It would have been a lot easier and would cost me less without having to pay for shipping.",

I have just received in the mail my first ever mission for them and I'm really excited!! Thanks to Smiley360, I get to try Emergen-C for my first mission & I have to say I do like it a lot. I love that they have so many delicious flavors to choose from. They also make special blends for kids, immune system, and low calorie!! I have already referred this products to many of my friends and family, of which all seemed pretty excited to try it. I love that it helps increase your energy naturally and it's good to drink before working out so you can be nice and energized to workout, there are so many reasons to try this product, that I could sit here all day and type about it but then people probably wouldn't read it because they don't feel like reading a book. :) So I will end my review with this!!! >>> I totally recommend this product and to get more information or even free samples you can go to their site. & you can also join Smiley360 for free so you too can start receiving free products to try and write reviews about you will not be disappointed, it's so much fun!!!\n\nThank you for reading. :)",
