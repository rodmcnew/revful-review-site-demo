I liked how the pen game exact instructions on how to move the pen to form each letter. I also like the option of reading stories or playing educational games with each book. As a teacher and a parent, I would recommend this product. These opinions are my own and were not influenced by LeapFrog.",

      "reviewText": "My 4 yr old daughter just received this book for her birthday. I loved the idea of her learning to write along with a story to keep her interest. She loved listening to the story and then tracing the letters in the book as part of a \"game\". I wish the letters had more to do with the story, but it didn't seem to bother her. The selection of games within the book includes tracing letters as well as identifying letter sounds. The pages within the book where the pen actually writes are great for practicing letters, but these are one time use pages and I think she is going to be disappointed when she has filled them all in. I gave it a lower rating for value because I do not see any replacement packs for the paper once we have used it all (if this is/becomes available my rating for this would increase). The pen needs the lines of each letter to be written in a certain order. This frustrated my daughter occasionally because a line she traced didn't count because it wasn't the line the pen wanted next. Also it seems to talk a fair amount before telling her to start writing. If she starts writing before it is done talking it doesn't always register correctly and she has to start over even if she has drawn the correct line. This can be frustrating when she is trying to learn. Overall it seems to be a good product for little ones just learning to write.",

      "reviewText": "Learn to write Letters . Mr. Pencil presents Doodleburg rocks. On one of the pages it has a piano and I tried it out and kids can play the keyboard with the leapreader. Besides practicing writing upper case and lower case letters. It teaches the sounds the letters make in a fun way . For example N -M -A letters the kiddos click them in any order and it plays back the fun tune using the sound the letters make. We like it so much I am thinking about buying the Learn to write numbers.",
