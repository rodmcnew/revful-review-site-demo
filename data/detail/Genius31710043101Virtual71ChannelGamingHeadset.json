      "reviewText": "This headset works great, the only problems I've had is the volume wheel is on the back and if I lay back in my chair the volume can change. Not a big deal though. The default setting for sound was a little muffled, but since I configured it, it works great now. Mic could be a little longer because I have to change the sensitivity so they can hear me, but then they can hear the game, which would be negated if the mic was longer. They are comfortable to wear, but my ears will sweat from being closed in the ear cups. Overall they are a good headset, had too many problems with wireless ones and I'm sitting in front of my setup so wireless is just a wasted expense and they are wired while charging so whats the difference.",
