As one other person said you have to watch where you are pointing the exhaust port so you don't blow anything over you didn't mean to. I love it. Oh, and it's made in the U.S.A.",

      "reviewText": "I use this primarily for cleaning our cars, but it also will be useful on furniture and stair steps. The vacuum body is smaller than expected (good) and lightweight. The body comes with a simple strap so you can control it and the vacuum attachment (which I typically use on the end of the hose). The noise level is loud, about that of a regular vacuum cleaner. For the amount of time it is used, its not an issue. The suction is good, and the turbine brush attachment works well at picking up stubborn hair and dust that is more embedded into the carpet. The blowing end is useful for first flushing out under the seats and really hard to reach areas, then follow up with a vacuuming.",
