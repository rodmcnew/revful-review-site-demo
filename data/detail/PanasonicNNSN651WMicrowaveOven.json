      "reviewText": "Walmart was charging only 99.99 on line. If you buy it in the store it was about 150. I had it delivered to a store with the online price. Was even cheaper than Amazon. Easy to use, high power for its size. Gets good ratings from all the consumer magazine. I haven't found anything bad with it yet.",

      "reviewText": "Love this microwave! Had to get used to the inverter way of heating (you select the degree of heating strength and then set the time.) Don't let this deter you--you get a guideline for common foods in the manual, and if a dummy like me can get used to it quickly so can you. At first I thought I'd made a mistake because of this extra step but really, constant heating results in more even cooking performance instead of the traditional \"all or nothing\" way a traditional mic does it (I make a lot of baked potatoes as I'm single and say goodbye to hard spots from the previous!).\nAlso, I'm very happy with the quality of this mic (thank you Panasonic for an easy-to-open door!). Some people find fault with the light not staying on when you open the door but with the positives I don't mind.\nThere's a button called Sensor Reheat which automatically reheats food that works well for me that I also really like (push the button and the sensor detects steam to take the guesswork out of what to set it at).\nWalmart site-to-store a plus as I don't have to worry about my package being stolen if I'm not home and a competitive price too.",

      "reviewText": "There are only two things wrong with this microwave.\n1. the interior light only goes on when the microwave is running. It is dark when you first put anything in it or take anything out!\n2. The front panel is also dark and hard to read. We had to pull the microwave up to the edge of the counter to see the panel.\nOther than these points, it is a great microwave. It really reheats foods until they are hot. And we haven't had any problems cooking . Good value for a good price.",

      "reviewText": "I had a very good experience with Panasonic microwave oven.The one I gave my mother as a gift 31years ago end its life last month. When my Kenmore microwave stop working only in 14 months, I purchase this Panasonic microwave immediately. However, I am a little worried, since both of them have the patterned inverter technology. It means there is a connection between the two. Hope this Panasonic product has reliability as good as before.",
