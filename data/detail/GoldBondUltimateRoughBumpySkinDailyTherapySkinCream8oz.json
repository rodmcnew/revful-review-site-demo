      "reviewText": "The Gold Bond Cream did just what it said it would. My rough and bumpy skin is almost totally gone. For years I felt ashamed to show my arms and legs because of the red bumps and ingrown hairs. The cream is thick and somewhat sticky feeling for a few minutes, but my skin feels smooth and soft. I am 100% happy.",
