      "reviewText": "I lost my good pair of earrings. They were a gift from my boyfriend. I knew it would break his heart, so I bought two pair so I could wear them for the holidays. The more expensive ones came first. They were so cheap looking, my bff noticed the quality right away. This person is legally blind. Two days later, however these earrings came to my door. What a surprise. They looked just like the ones my better half gave me.....So much so that I told the boyfriend about the loss, yes he was upset, that was expected....but he wasn't so hurt that I couldn't be forgiven.......\nThese earrings were beautiful. As fate would have it, We found the original pair......they were in my dresser drawer.",
