Since the unit fails before the card does for me.\n\nMine are all beaten daily by a paint a shop, so I need to keep track of vitals before they fail.",

The status notifications have show several sites that over voltage was being received and flagged repairs that were needed. This has more than paid for the purchase and install costs. We are installing these cards at all locations. I recommend you do too.",

      "reviewText": "It's hard to fall in love with the network management card for a UPS - not a very sexy product. One thing I can say about these, though, is that they work exactly as advertised and last forever.\n\nMy best tip: Get the MAC address off the sticker before installing the card (because you can't always read it from the enclosed test results printout). Then create a DHCP reservation for the card before connecting it to the network. This will save you figuring out or running the utility to determine the unit's IP address.\n\nI had to update the firmware to match that of another UPS for redundancy purposes. Although the firmware takes a little while to update itself, the process itself is easy to do from your workstation - don't hesitate if you have a reason for updating.",
