      "reviewText": "For being a Black and Decker I'm more than a little disappointed with this trimmer. It is supposed to cut up to 3/4 inch branches. It will cut twigs and small 1/4 inch branches fine, but anything bigger than that is a stretch. It chews on the branch until it finally cuts through, but the cut isn't clean or quick. It was easier and quicker to get the manual cutters out. Kind of defeats the purpose of buying a power trimmer. The ragged cut can't be good on the hedge. When done it looked like a herd of beavers came through and trimmed my hedge.",
