      "reviewText": "I have used Gillette Fusion razors and cartridges for years now, finding them the most comfortable and (generally) effective blade/handle system on the market. They are also ridiculously overpriced. But if one wanted a decent, comfortable, shave, then one was forced to pay the piper. Until now. On a lark, I picked up a Bic Hybrid Advance 4 just to give it a try. Glad I did. While it is not *quite* as smooth a shaving experience as the Gillette, I think the Bic system actually shaves better. The blade \"bite\" or angle of attack seems to do better at getting stubborn neck whiskers around my protrusive adam's apple and the flexible head handles facial gullies better. I do tend to nick myself a bit more than with the Gillette, which is superb in that regard, but the closer shave and the better price are worth it. Good razor, cheaper blades, what's not to love? This thing is going to save me some money.\n\nPlease note one thing: Bic does not sell blade refills by themselves at this time. Each time you buy blades, you get a new handle. It is plastic and fairly cheaply constructed, but I think Bic would be wise to sell a heavier metal handle and then allow us to buy large packs of blade cartridges.",
