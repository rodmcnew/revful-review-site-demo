      "reviewText": "I have had good results with Scotts EZ Seed. Grass will grow just about anywhere within a week or two. However, I've found that just by itself that it can be a quick growth that doesn't live long. For best results, I've used EZ Seed along w/ a cheaper bulk (50lb bag) seed and find that I get quick growth from the EZ seed and the durability from the regular seed.",

I planted the seed in March and after 6 or 7 months it still growing full no bare spots looks great the wife loves it and will get more for any problem areas in the yard. Very pleased with the results.",

Then i got Scotts EZ seed. now 3 weeks later i have a full groth of new grass in all the bare areas and have had to mow it for the first time. I live in the SW and have to water daily as thr ground is very poor, i have a dessert landscape in the rest of the area.",

      "reviewText": "I really wasn't sure what to expect after reading all of the reviews. I followed the directions exactly. Very thin layer and bag covered exactly what was listed on the bag.\n\nI started out by raking all of the area were I planned to spread the EZ Seed. I would estimate 50% of my back yard was either dead or missing. I have a large male dog and suspect both urine damage and grub damage were the culprit. I am guilty of neglecting the lawn in the few years I've lived in this house. After clearing the area, I waited for it to rain that evening. In the morning I raked the area again since the soil was soft - roughing up about 1/4\". I spread the EZ Seed per instructions on the bag - thin enough to see bare dirt though the mix.\n\nAfter spreading a thin layer I watered the area lightly, let it dry and watered again. I noticed that a good portion of the seed had come to the surface. I raked everything around and watered it again. After settling over night I raked it around again and watered lightly. This was to make sure the seed was mixed well into the soil and mix.\n\nWe had a full week of rain with little to no sun. After that week I watered three times a day - morning, lunch and right after work. Just enough to keep it wet. It has been four weeks since spreading the EZ Seed and I can no longer see bare dirt in my backyard. The new grass is about 2\" right now. I continue to lightly water three times a day since we haven't had any good rain.\n\nAs skeptical as I was initially about this product I am surprised how well it looks and has filled in. I did luck out and catch a 50% off sale at Lowes so I bought the 20lb bag. Knowing that it works I would feel comfortable purchasing this product at street price. The biggest advice I would give is to spread it thin and keep it wet. Water!",
