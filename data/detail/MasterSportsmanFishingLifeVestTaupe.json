      "reviewText": "I needed something quick and easy for kayak fishing. The fit is great. A half vest fit perfect for kayaking. the two large pockets (with zippers - decent ones) are large enough to hold small tackle boxes for small plugs. The rest of the pockets have served me fine for plastic worms in their ziploc bags and bobbers and such.\n\nThat said, the material is quite thin, and the velcro that holds shut the small pockets is sub standard.\nI chose to install snap closures to mine, since I'm carrying extra spools for my fishing reels, and I don't want them getting lost due to a roll over.\n\nThe fit is great and very breathable. does not limit motion at all. Very easy to forget your wearing it.\n\nI have only used it twice and have not had a chance to try its buoyancy, but I'm sure that is a non issue.\n\nOverall a great product that can serve you well if your kayaking or boating.",

      "reviewText": "I bought this vest because I liked the pockets, color, and the mesh to keep cool. I was concerned at first having ordered a size L/XL because I'm a bit skinny( 6'1\" and 150 lbs) it was big when I first put it on but luckily the straps tightened the vest up nice and snug- perfect fit. The D rings on the bottom are perfect for attaching leashes to hold various things so you don't lose them in the water. You can't buy a vest this nice anywhere else for under 50$. Great buy!",

Lots of pockets for all of my fly boxes and other paraphernalia that I normally bring along but never use.....admit it, you know you do it too. Would definitely recommend to a friend - so go get you one!",
