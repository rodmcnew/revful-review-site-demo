The speeds on this are awesome, you will need USB 3.0 to take full advantage of the faster rates, if this is hooked up to USB 2.0 it will fall back to those rates. The build quality is great too, all in all a very good purchase!",

      "reviewText": "I believe that 64-bit Operating systems will eventually take over the market (may be many years until that happens). In anticipation I am using Windows 8 64-bit for my system. This memory card reader is compatible with that operating system and works very well. The USB 3.0 interface utilizes the fastest data transfer rates for most systems. I researched the market for such devices before I made my purchase. SIIG is a company which designs their products to take a piece of the market share of the future and this excellent product is a result of very good design principles.\nThere is only one complaint this card occasionally receives from buyers: people complain about the price, which is higher than the average memory card but for good reason. The speed and compatibility are what makes this card reader the best in its class. For anyone who ever wants to transfer high definition video from their camera's memory card to their computer, you really want to have the speed this device offers. You might be able to find a cheaper USB 3.0 card reader, but just because a reader supports USB 3.0 does not make it fast. It must also be designed for speedy data transfer and no other card reader tops this one.",

      "reviewText": "If you have a USB3 port in your computer, it will be blazing fast at speed of upto 5Gb/s or 5000 Mb/s transfer speed, with today’s camera each photo could be 1 to 20 Mb and more so for video, so if you take many photos (as you know using your camera and connecting it to the computer could take a very long time to transfer the photos and videos to your computer) using this card reader will save you ton’s of time, it’s pricy at about $28 would have liked it to be close to $10",
