      "reviewText": "I've never really ever needed bug spray before. However, when I go to North Carolina to visit my grandparents, we go shooting on a farm in the woods - and boy are there bugs! You can easily see the entire swarm of mosquitos and see the ticks everywhere.\n\nHowever, spraying a paper towel with this stuff and rubbing it on exposed skin then spraying it on pant legs completely eliminates problems from both!\n\nEven more so: I'm the kind of person who doesn't even like bugs flying around me - and they don't. I can sit there for five minutes really still lining up my shot and not a single bug enters my field of view.\n\nThis stuff is fantastic.",
