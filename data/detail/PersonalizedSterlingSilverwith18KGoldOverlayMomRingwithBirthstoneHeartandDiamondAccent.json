      "reviewText": "When I saw this ring online,I thought it is the perfect gift for my mother.But when I go the product.. It looked nothing to what my expectations were. With the color online and the color of my mothers birthstone,it looks tottaly different .With every thing. And I think it isn't worth almost $60.00. Not for a fake white diamond that doesn't sparkle.And her birthstone doesn't make the ring look good at all..at least thats what I think.",

After receiving the ring I read the reviews posted my others for this ring and I would have to say that it does appear different online and when getting it in the mail yes the heart is a little bigger than expected but honestly what could you expect? I myself love the ring and would recommend it to all of my friends!",
