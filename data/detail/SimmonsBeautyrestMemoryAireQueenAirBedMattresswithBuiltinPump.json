I ordered one as we were going on a vacation to the coast and had quite a few people going along so there were not enough beds in the Condo for everyone. It was so nice because we could inflate it at night and deflate it in the morning to get the bed out of the way. It never lost any air and was so comfortable to sleep on!! I highly recommend this product.",

      "reviewText": "My boyfriend and I recently moved into a new apartment to discover that our stairway and hallway leading into the bedroom upstairs is so very narrow that it is impossible to get any sort of large furniture up there let alone a mattress so my mom took pity on us and gave us one of her air mattresses. Perfect for getting up there because it can fold up but it was always losing air in the night and finally 2 months later the sucker started coming apart at the seams. After all that jazz I was looking for an air mattress that would be good for long-term use, good quality, that was sturdy and wouldn't easily lose air, and most of all comfortable. After sleeping on the floor while waiting for this air mattress to show up, it was laying on a cloud when we pumped it up. I can tell it will last a long time! To make this review a little shorter I'll summarize the pros and cons...\n\nPros: Very comfy! Made with thick sturdy material. Comes with a little patch kit in case you get any holes. Not sure what the soft fuzzy stuff is called on the top and sides but it holds the sheets in place which is great for people like me that roll around in their sleep. The pump is pretty quiet compared to most. Comes with a very nice canvas-like bag for when you want to store it away.\n\nCons: Very strong plastic smell out of the box but after airing out its not so bad. Seems like its not quite a queen...big enough for the two of us because we like to cuddle, but for those that like their space while they sleep it might be a little small. The \"memory\" foam (seems like just regular foam padding) must be very thin because it's not as squishy as I was hoping but it does make it a bit more comfy than the average air mattress.\n\nOver all, I would highly recommend it.",

      "reviewText": "I'll start out with, it's inches smaller than my other air mattress. It may take a fill then a few short air ups. Now the reason I rated it so high, the sleeping surface it's flat and very comfortable unlike the \"pillow top\"offered by others. Fitted queen sheets fit perfect. I'll just say that it feels so perfect to sleep in. It's a bed with no comparison",
