      "reviewText": "Not only has this little battery powered shaver exceeded the company's advertising of 60 minutes of operation on one set of AA's but I'm already up to 17 shaves! The surprising thing is that those shaves have been as close or closer than my much larger and much more expensive Norelco electric shaver. May be using it for more than just travel! Have bought a handful of them as gifts. Store price was higher than online price at the time. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewText": "My husband had a very old version of this for the longest time that finally went caput a few years ago and we could never find these - or weren't looking in the right places. I was elated to see this online and picked it up. He's used it several times since I've given it to him and it never pulls on his hair. Very versatile for hair that grows in different directions, compact so he can use it to shape his goatee and still shave larger areas of his face. I would definitely recommend and you just can't beat the value. He prefers this over some of the really expensive shavers I've purchased in the past.",

      "reviewText": "I've used battery operated shavers for years, all of them foil shaver and this is the first rotary battery shaver.\nLet me point out that I have used rotary shaver before and never liked it more than foil shaver. I have another Norelco corded 3 head rotary shaver nearly unused in my drawer. I like this 2 head shaver much better, probably because the head is smaller, follow the contour of my face easier.\nCompare to foil shaver, this seems to shave deeper unlike my previous experience with the rotary, and it runs much quieter. Another benefit is that the cutter will last longer on this than foil, main reason for the switching.\nNegative side is it takes longer to shave because the actual cutting area is 2 points instead of 1 line on foil, you have to go many more swipes to get the shave done.\nOver all, I'm happy with this purchase and currently testing how long the batteries(Eneloop) will last before they need the charge again.",

I was impressed with the high quality construction of the razor, and although I only used it for a few seconds on one side of my face, I could tell it would give me about the best shave I could expect from an electric razor. It even came with batteries installed! I am thinking about buying more of these either to give away as gifts or to keep for myself.",
