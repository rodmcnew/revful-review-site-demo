      "reviewText": "This is the best product that I have EVER used! I have long (below the waist) naturally blond, mostly straight, VERY dry hair. It is very thick and without a really good moisturizer, tends to break. Also, if I do not wash it every day, it drys out and breaks. I started using Silk Drops about 2 years ago. I swear by this product! It is absolutely the best. I swim several times a week, and the chlorine also damages my hair. After swimming, my hair feels like straw. On the days I swim, I wash it TWICE. It leaves my hair feeling strong, healthy, soft, and looking very shiny.\n\nI not only have very dry hair, but dry skin as well. Without a good moisturizer, my skin is very dry and it leaves a very uncomfortable feeling. One day at the pool, I realized that I forgot my facial moisturizer. I looked at the Silk Drops and thought \"What the heck.\" I knew my hands always felt soft and oil free after using it. So, I put it on my face. WOW! Now I use Silk Drops as a daily and nightly moisturizer as WELL as a hair conditioner! It is absolutely awesome! In addition, it is FAR less expensive than the VERY costly moisturizers I am used to using and actually does a far better job. My skin does not feel oily. It just feels soft and looks healthy. I suggest that anyone who has not tried it, that this is yet another reason to purchase Silk Drops. It is abxolutely AWESOME! I recommend it to everyone that I know - for whatever skin type and hair type - whether they have oily, dry, frizzy, straight, curly hair. It works!\n\nA friend recommended it to me and I am SO greatful she did. Now I recommend it to EVERYONE!",

It makes her hair shiny, silky, soft and smooooooth and so much more prettier when using the flat iron. This is the BEST product you can get for the money you'll spend. Not to mention**it has all the essential ingredients your hair needs. The down side; You can't buy it in the stores, only online.",

      "reviewText": "This product is great for frizzy, brittle hair. It makes it nice and soft and shiny. The only problems I had is that I have very long hair and I tended to put too much in my hands and when you do that, it makes your hair greasy. So a little bit goes a long way. Also, since I have long hair, I don't brush it but maybe once a day and I always got tangles underneath. That may just be my hair, but the serum didn't stop or help the tangles. But it's such a great product. My momma uses it too and she dies her hair blonde and it really helps with the brittleness",

This stuff also lasts a long time; you only need a few pea-sized drops in damp hair, and your hair becomes a lot shiner and softer. My mother told me that the salon recommend this for her hair when she got her hair done a long time ago. Great buy, you won't regret purchasing this.",
