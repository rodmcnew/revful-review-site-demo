      "reviewText": "Wow! SOG got it right with this one. I love that the knife actually has a bit of weight. The new button release is definitely an improvement. I like that the safety is out of the way and it no longer changes positions in my pocket. Also, gotta love SOG's pocket clips. The blade design is both beautiful AND functional with no blade play. The jimping on this knife is wonderful, it really locks your thumb in place. And last but not least, the assisted opening on the zoom is super fast and solid, there is no wiggling or hesitation! This knife is a HUGE step in the right direction. Thank you SOG.",
