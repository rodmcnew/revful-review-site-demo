      "reviewText": "I had the plastic 5 tier shelves which don't have wheels. When ever I had to move it I would have to take things off of the shelves and rearrange everything. It was used in a basement closet where the sewer guy needed to get to an access panel. This is so much easier and sturdier. The wheels glide with ease and lock if needed.",

Sturdy and fairly attractive, it was easy enough to assemble, though I would recommend two people for the job to make leveling easier. I didn't put the casters on it, although they were of high quality. Provides ample space for storage. I recommend.",
