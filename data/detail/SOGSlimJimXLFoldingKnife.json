      "reviewText": "I've owned my SLIMJIM for almost a year and it has outperformed all other previous knives. I was hesitant due to the price, but decided to treat myself when it was time for a new knife and have never regretted it.\n\nMy favorite thing about the SLIMJIM is the design! As the name states it is a slim knife, but that's the beginning:\nIt is the perfect weight, size, and durability for me.\nIt is razor sharp right out of the package.\nThe blade lock is stiff enough to prevent accidents.\nThe positioning of the clip buries it in your pocket so it isn't obvious.\nBlade opening assist!\n\nI liked it so much last year, that I give the SLIMJIM as an occasional gift and as a frequent recommendation.",

      "reviewText": "Bought it because it was so slim, and was not disappointed. For its thin size, it is stronger than I expected and has a nice, quick release. It is a good knife to use for cutting, but anything where force or leverage it required to cut I feel like it wouldn't last as long. For what I use it for, I love it.",
