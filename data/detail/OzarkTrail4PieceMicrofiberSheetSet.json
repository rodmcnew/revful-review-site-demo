      "reviewText": "These sheets are really soft and good looking. i thought they would be hot and uncomfy but they are really soft and not hot at all. also generously sized pillowcases and sheets. they will fit over a 1 or 2 inch egg carton mattress topper no problem. my mattress is 12\" thick. . we really like these. i wish they had a matching blanket or quilt to go with it.",
