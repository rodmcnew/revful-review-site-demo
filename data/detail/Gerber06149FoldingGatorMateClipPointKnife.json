      "reviewText": "I've owned this knife for over 10 years and still use it to this day. Over the years it's taking a beating and if it ever breaks I will go buy another. Gerber knives have become my knife brand of choice. They offer great quality for a reasonable price and put some decent styles out there vs. just an ordinary pocket knife.",
