      "reviewText": "After my breastfed baby refused other bottles, we tried this one. He loves it! It looks like a breast, is comfortable to hold, and the nipple seems \"softer & smoother\" then other bottles we tried. I guess since a breastfeeding company makes it, they tried to get close to \"the real thing.\" :) The only drawback, it's a little harder to heat the bottle since the milk is in more of a concentrated area but you can always just warm it up in the storage bags, then pour in.",

The nipple is extremely soft to the touch and she holds the bottle the same way she holds me. It's perfect!",
