      "reviewText": "This laid down flat in a couple of days, then I sealed with 1 layer of Hilway direct plus then a second layer of Hilway direct high gloss. It really looks great. I am using two colors black where the cars park and surrounding it with a grey border. This costs just 30% of what it would have if I would have gone with Race Deck tiles. Highly recommend G-floor for quality, looks and ease of installation. Walmart prices were well below everyone else. If you are thinking about it, do it and then buy some Hilway to seal it and make it pop (it is well worth it).",

      "reviewText": "I have a room below my garage and during the winter water was leaking through the concrete slabs to the room below. Sealing the garage floor doesn't work with - it cracks and also gets through on the edges. This product worked great. Three sheets for a 2.5 car garage. I have the edges going up the walls a few inches and the seams slightly raised and duct taped and it works like a bathtub. Whenever the cars are out of the garage I just use a push broom and push all the water out.\n\nIt doesn't lay flat, at least not yet, and if you turn the tires while on the mat it does bunch up a little, but it 100% solves my water problem.",
