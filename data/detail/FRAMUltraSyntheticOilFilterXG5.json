Fram continues to be a primary brand of choice for most shops and this particular \"Xtended Guard\" model is the best of the group typically made for newer hi-tech engines, esp those running high temp synthetics.",

Not black like the engines back in the 80's. And I also use Lucas Heavy duty Stabilizer in every oil change. Have 62,000 miles on the engine/car.",
