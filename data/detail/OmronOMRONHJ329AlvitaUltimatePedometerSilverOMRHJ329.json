I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to count how many steps they are taking daily. I can go back and look at 7 days of steps I have taken.",

I like every thing about this device. I like the way it counts my steps and it can be worn on your side at any time. Omron makes excellent products.",

This Omron pedometer works flawlessly if you set it up correctly. Size is perfect and it clips to your clothes or can be used in your pocket. Great price at walmart.com. Highly recommended.",

And it said the battery was already in and it wasn't (it was in plastic bag) - The lady that had the same make could not figure out how it worked either - I am going to return it and I think you have other models.",
