      "reviewText": "Got a chance to check out this mouse at a friend's house the other night with some Guild Wars 2. It was highly recommended to me because of the functionality of the 12 side keys and how it pretty much makes your keyboard hand more available for movement instead of button mashing. I fell in love with it!\nThe buttons on the side take a little bit of getting used to, but once you get the feel for it, you wonder how you EVER got along without it. I would recommend this mouse to any gamer...",

It's a lot more comfortable and I'm hoping I won't have any issues with it. For gaming, I'd highly recommend this mouse. It's a lot easier to figure out what key is which number. Still getting used to the two buttons below the wheel but it's nothing I can't figure out.",

      "reviewText": "I was gifted this mouse after drooling over it for a few months, and it not only met my expectations, but completely surpassed them. I wanted it mainly for playing MineCraft, so that I could change weapons more efficiently. I quickly got used to this, not only because of the great placement of buttons, but also because of the ability to disable the scroll wheel(yes, it really is THAT customizable). It exceeded my expectations when I found out that Razer Synapse 2.0 lets you have multiple keymaps. I currently have one for playing MineCraft, and another for browsing the web, and I have never surfed the internet faster. If you have the money and are even vaguely considering buying this mouse, it is definitely worth your while. Whether you are an MMO player, a casual gamer, or don't play games and you're just a fan of efficiency, you will be more than satisfied with your purchase.",
