      "reviewText": "This printer steps up my business image. It is affordable, has a higher resolution than average (sharper color prints), handles heavier stock (great for presentation covers), and fast. Small print jobs can now be done in house at a lower cost than sending out to print. The cartridges are expensive but the life span (number of pages) is much better. My company provides employee benefits and we set high standards of performance to our clients. The HP printer delivers for us.",
