      "reviewText": "I am so pleased with this trampoline I was scared at first that it would be to small for my soon to be 5 year old. I was wrong it is perfect! We had one of the huge ones but it got destroyed in a tornado and I wanted something that I could take down or that would fit in my garage if it needed to. This is perfect for both. I was also afraid that she wouldn't like this one because it is a lot smaller then the one we had before. But my little girl loves this one better then the big one. I would recommend this to anyone including my worst enemy. LOL",
