Whoever says they have a hard time stomaching this is obviously not familiar with all the other off tasting proteins out there.Also love the idea that I can slam down 60 grams (2 scoops) of protein & not consume like 80 grams of cholesterol.Although I would suggest only going for 1 scoop per serving being as the body can only realistically consume 30 to 40 grams of protein @ a time.Tested many & sticking with this because it's clean & taste great.",

I am lifting weights and exercising 5 times a week so I need a whey protein product for a meal replacement on my tennis days. This product is great. No stomach upset, great taste and good value. In 6 months I have lost almost 13 pounds and have added muscle, major to my upper body. I am very happy with this product and the price is right, I will continue to use it as I build more muscle mass.",

Unfortunately I couldn't find the label information on the Walmart website or forgot to check and ordered this product. I read the label upon delivery and was dismayed to find the Walmart product does not match the information on the manufacturers website. I'm burning fat and toning in the gym by counting carbs so every gram counts, and one sketchy nutrition label can throw me off track for days.",

      "reviewText": "I noticed a lot of bad reviews due to flavor and chalkiness. Perhaps others are more used to whey protein with lactose and high carbs. This isolate has high protein and relatively low sugars / carbs. I'm in my 40s and training again, so I decided to give it a try. I've used a variety of protein products over the years, and most tasted much worse than this stuff. Even mixed with water I find it palatable, and you can add juice or other flavorings to your liking.\n\nI will update my review with results in a month.",
