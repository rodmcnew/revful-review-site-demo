      "reviewText": "These work great for pulling deer out of the woods even if there is no snow on the ground. You do not have to worry about legs getting caught and this will protect the hide of your buck if you are getting it mounted. add gromet holes to the top of the walls so you can secure the legs with rope. I promise this will make dragging deer by yourself much easier. My husband has dragged 25 deer from the woods with this.",

      "reviewText": "We've only used this at the beach to carry enough gear for 4 adults & 2 kids, 4 beach chairs, 2 beach umbrellas, bag of towels, large bag of snacks, toys & a large cooler with a days drinks. I drilled a few holes in the top for bungee cords to hold it down as we pull it across the dune bridge & thru the sand. I added a 24 inch piece of flex tubing on the tow rope to give a larger smooth grip. Many people have asked where they can get this as it works great. It fits down in a car trunk without taking up valuable space on a 11 hour trip as the large suitcase fits right inside & leaves room to stack the rest on top. It still looks good after 3 years.",
