      "reviewText": "We purchased this after our previous microwave stopped working. Fixing it was going to be close to $100, so we just opted to buy a new one. Our previous was also a panasonic, which was the best I had owned, so wanted to go back with panasonic. After buying it, I got the consumer reports best buys book in the mail...checked it and sure enough, this exact microwave is ranked #2, and a cr best buy. Sure felt good to see that!!\nMy favorite features of this microwave are the inverter defrost and sensor cook.",

      "reviewText": "We purchased this product about 1 year ago. Our old one had bitten the dust and we were in the market for a new one that was of similar size. This was the only model of the size we were looking for at out local Walmart so we ended up purchasing it because of that fact alone.\nWe haven't been disappointed with it yet.\nThe only problem we really have is the button to open the door is sticking from being poked so many times.\n\nSomethings to keep in mind before purchasing this item.\n1. This guy has 1250 watts inside so watch what your cooking and make sure you adjust your recipes accordingly. Most microwave recipes are based on 990 watts.\n2. Most popcorn cooks in under 3 minutes. Try 2 minutes and 30 seconds for this microwave. If my 4 year old can make it without burning it than anyone can. She uses the button and waits to hear the popping slow down.\n3.The front is going to acquire fingerprints no matter how much you try to keep it clean if you have a multiple users.\n4. The turbo defrost might actually cook your food if it's not frozen flat but this is something that I see with a lot of microwaves.\n5. When you use the sensor reheat make use to stir it at some point other wise it will be steaming hot on the edges but the middle will be ice cold.",

      "reviewText": "I am like several of the reviewers. I bought my Panasonic Microwave in the summer of 2007. One year hadn't even gone by when it just stopped working. I took it to get it fixed and it seemed fine. Well, quess what? It is once again broken. It will go for 2 seconds and just stop. I am rather frustrated because now I have to get another microwave. What really bothers me is that I had a Panasonic microwave before this one and it lasted for about 15 years. I don't know about anyone else, but with the economy like it is I can't afford to go and buy a new one every year or two. I feel that we shouldn't have to. Previously I owned Panasonic because has always been a good product. I don't recommend this model to anyone and I won't buy it again either. I will still get Panasonic products, just not this model.",

      "reviewText": "The unit worked OK for about three years, but the same fate as other users. I'm an electronics tech\nand finally got around to pulling the cover to see if\nI could diagnose the fault. The oven was doing the same thing others described on this blog, ran briefly\nand shuts off. Turns out the HV inverter or, the high voltage power supply is arcing, smoking and failed.\n\nPanasonic's website shows the replacement board\nis about $85. Tried eBay for the part and as good as eBay often is for used or refurb'ed repair parts, knew that to be a really long shot... no luck there.\n\nMy advice: this unit has a defective or marginal P/S board design and is waiting for a good opportunity to die. So, don't waste your money on this model.\n\nOpen the pod bay doors HAL... I can't do that Dave.",

It works for about two seconds when you press start, then it just turns black and stops working. This seems to be a very common problem with this model. I would purchase a different model to avoid the headache.",
