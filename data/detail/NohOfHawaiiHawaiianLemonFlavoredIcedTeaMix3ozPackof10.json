I make a point of ordering some to be shipped to a hotel or wherever I might be staying in the US since I can't get it in Canada.\n\nThere is no powdery taste, the flavor is very clean, and it's sweet but not too sweet.\n\nNot to mention it is all natural.\n\nHighly recommended!",

      "reviewText": "This instant tea is so much better than any other I've had. The taste is very delicate. The convenience of 1 qt. Packets makes it easy to refill if you're the one who takes the last glass. There's no other way to describe it other than \"simply delicious\". We have been drinking this tea for about 3 years and just recently found that Wal-Mart offers it online. So far, I don't know of anywhere I can purchase it locally.",
