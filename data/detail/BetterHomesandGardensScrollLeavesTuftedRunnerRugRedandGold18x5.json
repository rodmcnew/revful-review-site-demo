      "reviewText": "The carpet is very soft (not scratchy or with a super tight weave), and features a rubber, non-slip backing similar to a bathroom mat, so it's great on hard surfaces without having to spend extra money on a pad for it. The color is a rich, deep wine red and not burgundy or orange-y, which was perfect for our home. I highly recommend this rug.",

      "reviewText": "After my initial purchase of the runner and the matching area rug pieces at Wal-Mart, I decided to purchase another runner on line. Color palate is burgundy and golden mustard. It compliments and matches the colors in the other area rugs throughout my home. The quality is excellent for the price that was paid. You donâ€™t have to buy a luxurious product to get the look of expensive taste.",
