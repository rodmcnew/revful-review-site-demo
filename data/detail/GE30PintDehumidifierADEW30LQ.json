      "reviewText": "This review is based on approx 1 month of usage only\n\nIt seems to work well in an area the size of a fairly large living room. It's super easy to operate. Almost no setup required for this equipment, just removing tape (and connecting a garden hose if you decide to do that).\n\nThe water collection bucket only holds a gallon of water. It does have a way to hook a garden hose up to it, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Emptying and replacing the water collection bin is a cinch!\n\nThe drawback is that it's VERY LOUD (much louder than my previous dehumidifier), so you will not want it running if you are trying to sleep or watch TV on same floor level. [If your basement is very large or and sectioned off with walls, you will probably need more than 1 unit. Two of these would be way too noisy to deal with.]\n\nThe beep/alarm that is supposed to let you know when the water bin is full and the unit has stopped running is NOT loud at all so I find that feature useless.\n\nIt was pretty heavy for me to lug into my house and down into the basement - so if you're a lightweight or elderly, you'll probably want help for that.\n\nThe filter is just a little screen that's pretty much like a lint filter on a clothes dryer - very easy to remove and replace - appears to be easily cleaned (haven't had to clean it yet).",

      "reviewText": "I bought this for a replacement unit to run in a rental apartment. It will be used in a basement level apartment and in Ohio, that means moisture! It has some features that the last one didn't have - you can adjust the percentage of humidity, you can set a shut-off timer for 2 or 4 hours. It has an external water level guide, so you can see if it is getting close to time to empty, or if there is a lot of room left. That is a nice feature. I think it is a good unit; time will tell, and it will get much use in the basement, because there is a good deal of moisture there in the summer. I need something dependable there, and I hope that this holds up well. I have had this for about 2 months now, and no complaints. Seems to run quieter than the old one too.",
