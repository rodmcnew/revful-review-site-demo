      "reviewText": "Item is extremely cheap, and of course that should probly be expected for the price. Anyhow it takes more seconds than the normal to switch to the other system and worst of all it conflicts with any USB printers you may have connected to your main computer #1. In my case I have a HP Laserjet 1020 printer and it always crashed with this KVM adapter. The only way I can get the printer to work is by switching to machine #2 and then back. THIS is extremely anoying!",

This product works very well and saves a lot of space by controlling both computers with one keyboard and mouse. It is also the best value for your money, other similar products cost at least double.",
