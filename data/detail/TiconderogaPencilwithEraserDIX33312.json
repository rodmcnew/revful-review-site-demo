      "reviewText": "These pencils were purchased for a 4 year old homeschooler. He did not need adaptive pencil grips due to the size, weight and shape of the pencil. Most people don't understand but learning the gradual stages of pencil grasp patterns are more complex than we realize. Shipping was expected to arrive in 4 business days came 2 days after order was placed so thanks Wal-Mart. Just some tips as you clearly must be buying for a toddler/preschooler lol . Have patience, you do not want your child to pair your frustration with learning. And everyone learns differently try adaptive pencil grips or play doh.",

      "reviewText": "Fits well in little hands. The thicker lead point on these pencils is harder to break than regular pencils, which is really good because kids usually press down kind of hard when learning to write. I like the bigger eraser also, comes in handy.. Beginners tend to make lots of mistakes. Hope his helps! Highly recommend these for beginners.",
