Small enough to fit comfortably in my pocket, lightening fast one hand deployment, easy one hand closure, rugged and completely reliable. I have looked at lots of other folders, but for my money this has them all beat.",

      "reviewText": "Opens/closes smoother than butter. The arc-lock is undeniably one of the best locking systems available on any knife. The unique re-curved tanto blade is awesome for virtually any cutting, slicing & stabbing. This is perfect for EDC or tactical or both. By far one of my favorite \"do it all\" knives in my collection and a must have for yours.",

Now that I have it I've learned a $130 lesson, don't buy the mini. It doesn't fit my hand worth a darn. Guess I have a nice, small letter opener for the Mrs.",
