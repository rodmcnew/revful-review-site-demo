Be sure to review where you want your cameras.....I really needed 6 cameras to cover my home,s exterior. Plus, the 60 ft cable was a little short for one of my placements. Overall, I am satisfied-",

The router and Internet set up can get tricky, depending on your router, the app won't give you control of the alarms, e-mail options, etc. for that you need to connect through a Windows computer in the same router. For the price it is a good buy.",

Getting the system up and running required a phone call to tech support. The mobile app for viewing away from my house worked 1 day. That required a phone call to tech support. Now it doesn't work . I'll have to call my cable provider. You need to have a lot of knowledge in computers to get the mobile app running. I'm happy I can view the cameras at my house but it isn't what I wanted. Remote viewing not so remote.",
