      "reviewText": "I have owned them all from a Ziess on down. Bushnell has been making quality scopes for a long time and I decide to jump off the VXIII band wagon and give the Bone Collector Series by bushnell a try. To make a long story short this scope after its initial zero on my S2 Weatherby 30-06 took about a 3 foot drop to the tile floor. I was sure it was done I mean no way a scope around 120 dollars at the local wal mart could handle that and keep its zero right........ to my suprise I picked it up and could not find any damage so I put 3 rounds down range to see how far off the zero was now. Didn't have to make a single adjustment its was still locked on and held a 3 shot group under 1 inch at 100 yards with Winchester Bulk ammo. I actually went out and purchased another one for my 30-30 on the way home. Very happy with this purchase!",

      "reviewText": "This scope is a good value. WIth the scope covers for convenience, a nice matte finish, nice positive controls and clear optics; this cope provides a good value for your money. It has become my go to economy scope and I am hard pressed to invest in a more expensive scope these days. I do find the reticle focus and pickup can be a little less crisp than a Leupold but a small adjustment of the eye piece for distance and it is back, and for half the price of the least expensive Leupolds the scope is a good deal and performs quite well.\nSome notes on using the DOA 600 Reticle:\nI have found the DOA 600 Reticle drops to be approximately:\n-3.50in @200 mark\n-12.75in @300 mark\n-29.25in @400 mark\n-54.50in @500 mark\n-90.50in @600 mark\nIf you match the yardage of the same drop for your bullet at each one of the marks, you can use the DOA reticle for whatever load you are shooting. Depending on your caliber and load each mark will correspond to a specific yardage, you just have to memorize these, judge distance, and interpolate the approximate hold off of each mark.\nNow that's a lot of info for a Walmart review...so get one of these and try it yourself.",
