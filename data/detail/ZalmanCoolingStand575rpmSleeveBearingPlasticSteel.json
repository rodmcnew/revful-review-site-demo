      "reviewText": "This product is really great and has kept my laptop far cooler than any other cooling stand that I've had in the past. My last cooling stand had only one fan that cooled the center of my laptop leaving the periphery hot. This product has fans throughout so that the entire base is being cooled. Its also a nice size- I'm sure it would accommodate really any size laptop. As some of the other reviewers stated its also super quiet... I can't even hear it.\n\nGreat purchase !",
