      "reviewText": "I have put a lot of hours on this Gear Head usb hub in just the last four days and am very pleased with its operation. I've had several hubs in the past and have had problems with them so I was a little concerned about using another one, but really had no other alternatives. My laptop has only two usb connections although I really need at least four.\n\nThe Gear Head was my choice because it is a company that has a reputation for turning out good products, and the price was right. It has run flawlessly without any issues. It is a quality product that is well made and looks even better than the picture. It is a little larger than I had thought it would be but that is not really an issue. I run Windows 8.1 and the Gear Headers were ready for that as well.\n\nMy only advice would be to read and follow the instructions when installing. You should be up and running in just a few minutes. If I run into any problems down the road I will update this review.",

      "reviewText": "I ordered the 4 port hub, instead of the 7 port one, not because of the price, but, because of the size. I have a new Dell Win 8.1 tablet that has a micro USB port (1 only) and it does not put out enough power to power a portable (2.5\") external HDD. I have my massive music collection on a 2 TB drive and needed something to power that drive, thus, the powered adapter. I use a micro USB to standard USB converter and plug the hub into it. Then plug my HDD into the hub. Then I plug in the hub and turn the power on. Drive now works great with my DJ software, on my tablet, and bluetooth jambox. Seems to be well built and is small enough to carry in a small case or backpack. I associate quality with the name \"Gear Head\".",
