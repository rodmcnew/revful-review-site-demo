I was a little thrown off by the consistency (more dense than whey protein), but it mixed great. If you're looking for an alternative to whey protein or just looking for a beef protein, give this product a shot.",

      "reviewText": "I received a free sample as part of the muscle tech field test team and I have to admit I was a little weirded out at the thought of powdered beef. After trying it, i can definitely recommend mixing it into your daily routine. It makes me a lot less bloated than whey powder and goes down a lot easier than I expected. It doesn't taste as good as some whey, but it's a lot better than you'd expect. Try it. you'll be surprised how much you like it.",

      "reviewText": "I received this as part of MTs beta team. The shake mixed well with little to no clumps. To be honest though in general I don't care for Caramel flavoring and this was no different. It may be worth a try for someone who enjoys Caramel flavoring and wants something different aside from the usual Whey proteins.",

First the nutritional information is amazing, really hard to beat in any category (fats, carb, sugar, protein) unless you hate carbs. And the taste....wow! Vanilla caramel. Yes, definitely try it out.",
