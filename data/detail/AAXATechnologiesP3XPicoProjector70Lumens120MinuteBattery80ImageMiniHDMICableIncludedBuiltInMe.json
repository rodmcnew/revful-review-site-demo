      "reviewText": "I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter. I reviewed several makes and models before settling on this one. It was a really good price, which first made me wary, but I figured it would be easy to return so I'd take a chance. My daughter had it up in running in less than 5 minutes! She loves it and loved showing everyone how neat it is. The clarity of the projection is amazing - just as good as anything I've seen at various business presentations. Not sure if it would be good from 100 feet away, but definitely no complaints from a normal room projection. To use it with an IPhone, you do need a special adapter, but it's available for about $30.",

      "reviewText": "Pretty cool projector I got over the holidays. Surprised they can make projectors hand held. I'm used the big huge projectors that stay put. This guy has the nice feature to play media right from USB instead of being hooked up to computer or other sources. Sound isn't great so I connect to my external ones and it plays just fine. Make sure to be in a dark room so you can get a nice image. Very convenient to show to friends and families your photos or videos of your trips.",

      "reviewText": "We bought this unit for my daughter for Christmas on 12/1/2014. It arrived on 12/8/2014 and we wanted to get it running before she opened it so we would have an idea of how it worked. Good thing we did because the unit didn't work at all. We hooked up the HDMI cable and had no sound but had a picture. Then we tried the RCA's and had sound but no picture. Then the power cord stopped charging the unit. I called the manufacture, AAXA, on 12/9/14 to try to resolve the issue. They said that it could be that the units we were trying to hook up to were to old. Considering one of the units is my 3D Blue Ray player that works with my Smart TV, I hardly think the components are the problem. So they said that there could be an issue with the cables. Then they agreed to send out a new HDMI and a new power cable. After waiting for 4 days for the cables arrived on 12/13/2014, now Christmas is only 12 days away, we tried to hook the unit up again. We had the same issue that we did before. So back on the phone I go. This time AAXA said that it could be a software issue and they would issue a Return and they would send me out a new unit. Well after sending this unit back on then waiting a week for the new unit to arrive, we finally received a unit on 12/18/2014 and that was supposed to work. Did it....NO. So back on the phone I go. And now they say it could be the cables again so on 12/19/2014 they ship out some new cables and on 12/22/2014 they arrive. At least we are located only about two hours from the manufacture or else shipping would have taken so much longer then it already has. Now Christmas is only a couple of days away. And did these new cables with the new unit work......NOPE. Now I am more then fed up with the run around, I went on Ebay and purchased an Epson for $250.00 otd. Then toay 12/31/2014 I called the manufacture back and this time they have really nothing to say other then they can send me out another unit and see if it works this time. I don't think so. If two units do not work then what makes them think I want to try a 3rd. So now here I am on 12/31/14 nearly a week after Christmas and I hook up the Epson for the first time. And needless to say, it works perfectly. Right out of the box I hooked to all of my components without an issue even my \"out dated\" Blue Ray player, my daughters laptop, and my HD DVD player. I didn't have to worry about faulty cables, or software issues. It just worked. Now the kicker is that while AAXA was giving me the run around, the return period through Wal-Mart has expired. So luckily I was able to get on the phone with Wal-Mart and they listened to my situation and agreed to honor the return. Had they not done that I would have been out the $190.00 that this projector cost me. I would have had to dispute it with my credit card and we all know what a pain that can be. So BEWARE of this unit and if it doesn't work right out of the box, return it and get your money back. Do not waste your time trying to figure out what can be wrong because you could get stuck with this useless piece of junk.",
