      "reviewText": "I had looked at this boat for years and debated about getting one. I need a boat that was stable, yet not too heavy. I wanted one with a good casting platform and easy enough for me to load and unload by myself. I needed a boat that was 12' or under yet one which provided enough room to be comfortable. I can use this boat to fish by myself or I can take my friends or grandkids along. My small gasoline motor (3.3 HP) pushes it along well and my trolling motor (42 LB) handles the boat easily. I ordered this boat using the Walmart delivery to my local store and the boat came in on a pallet with no damage. There were a couple of cosmetic dings, but nothing serious. The folks at my local store helped me load it and they were very helpful. On my first outing I had people coming up to find out more about my little \"bass boat\" The only negative I have to offer is why I did not purchase this boat years ago!",

Scuffed up some spots on bottom, dent on back from being hit with pallet jack. Not enought to send it back but not good.",

      "reviewText": "2nd boat we have from this manufacturer. The first is 12 years old and in great shape, just smaller. The new one is roomy, lots of locker space. Nice navigation lights and control panel. We have received lots of compliments on it. The seats with the extra shafts are a little too high. The regular seat height is good for me and I'm 6' 2\". Light enough to move it around on my flat bed trailer.\n\nVery happy with this boat.",

      "reviewText": "When I received my Pro 120, I was amazed at it's size and sturdy demeanor. It was much wider than I was expecting. Much more well constructed than I anticipated. I was just awestruck.\nWhen I first used my boat, the stable feel and ease of operation was just fantastic.\nReally, this is a great value and great fishing boat. I highly recommend it.\nThe only item that I would recommend to any potential buyer is that you really need a small boat trailer. It is not a small enough boat that you can just load it in the back of a truck and go, although it would fit in the back of a pickup with a full-size bed. It is large and cumbersome to handle. Two men can handle it. but 3 is better. Loading form the water to a boat trailer is the best way to go.",
