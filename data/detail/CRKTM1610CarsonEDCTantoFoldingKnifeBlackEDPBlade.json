      "reviewText": "The Brand CRKT is well known for quality and then Walmart's price is a perfect match to a epic knife. It is sleek, lightweight and great design with safety features needed to push it to the needed quality limit. The product came in perfect casing and condition and was shipped relatively quick. completely happy with my purchase and definitely would buy again since online was quick and easy plus had all brands my store may have not.",
