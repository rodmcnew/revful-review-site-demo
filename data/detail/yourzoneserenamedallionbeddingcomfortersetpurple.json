Still had the color of my daughter's walls so we kept it. I should also mention that there are many different colors (aqua, turquoise, several shades of pink, coral, navy, and a little lime green. We are very pleased.",

      "reviewText": "Bought two of these for my girls shared room. The chevron looks more pink to me in the picture on the walmart website but in person it is more of a pink/purple color but it is very pretty! Good quality construction. We bought the lime green and teal my zone sheet sets in store and mix and matched the sheet sets. We also painted their room with Valspar paint colors (well water for the teal color and a national park gray color). Overall very pleased with this purchase!",
