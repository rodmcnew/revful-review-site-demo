I have used many cleaners in the past that claim they are all surface and they are not. With this the residues are wiped out and the best of allâ€¦no streaking! The surface are left clean and sparkling and there are NO harsh chemical smells. Another fantastic product by Granite Gold!",

It works all over the house and has a light subtle smell.\nIt comes in a bottle with a nozzle so all you have to do is spray and clean.\nIt works great in the kitchen on the sinks, countertops, stove and even inside the fridge!! When you are done in there head straight to the bathroom cause it is safe to use in there too!!! I am exchanging this one product for 3 others that I was using.",

Yes I forget to add that is handy, to only use one product instead of three or more saving you time and money too!",

It cleans my kitchen counters, then lets me get the stove top, fingerprints on the fridge, and even any minor spots on the floor. Or if I need to do the bathroom this product has everything covered with no problems. I've even used it on some glass windows!",
