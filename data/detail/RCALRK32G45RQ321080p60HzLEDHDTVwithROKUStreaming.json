      "reviewText": "Bought this in time for a Christmas present at the discounted price. This RCA 32\" Big Screen has a nice picture and sound. Requires some on screen adjustments for best picture, sound and screen size. Notable features are energy saver, Roku wireless channels with Free registration (some channels charge money), Nice sound, and 32\" light weight Flat screen TV. The remote is a bit different than other remotes with flat buttons, and takes some time to get used to it. The side input buttons are a little weird, and remote requires certain pointing angles to work. Other than the remote there is no noticeable signs of trouble or problems. This flat screen and others have one problem that are notable which is the screen size. There are different viewing screen sizes, normal, wide, zoom, etc. Normal is too small, maybe only 26\" viewing size. And, zoom or cinema is too big and cuts off some of the picture and information. The standard should be normal with manual zoom levels to create the best size viewing picture for the available screen size.",

      "reviewText": "I bought this TV on sale and online without seeing or hearing it. I am disappointed in the picture and especially the sound. It's horrible! The color just does not compare with my old JVC that I have in another room. I do like the smart features that are available with this TV, I just wish it sounded better! I won't ever buy another RCA unless it's in a store that I can see and hear for myself before making a decision.",
