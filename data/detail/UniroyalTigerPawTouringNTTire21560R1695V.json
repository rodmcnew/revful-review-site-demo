      "reviewText": "I purchased 4 tires to replace Michelin tires which had met their milage warranty. These tires were rated highly and have exceeded my expectations regarding comfort and traction in snow. We do a lot of interstate driving at high speed, with a lot of secondary road travel, the tires have felt firm and handled perfectly. I would recommend them for people, encountering snow and rain issues, looking for a great value.",

Great value! I paid $103 per tire which compares very favorably with other tires that I was considering (Goodyear, Yokohama, Continental, Michelin etc) which ranged from $150 to $250.",

Give a very nice ride, and when you want to corner, they stick to the road as well as anything else out there.\n\nI spent 22 yrs. as a Performance Tech with Ford, did a lot of tire testing/evaluating, and have had other great experiences with Tiger Paw radials on the test track, as well as my own performance cars. Excellent, all-around tires, that will give you your money's worth.",
