      "reviewText": "At my job, I am on the computer ALL day and often spend quite a bit of time on the computer at home too. I was starting to have severe wrist and elbow pain and tried everything from wrist braces to special mouse pads to adjusting my chair and nothing worked. Finally, as a last resort, I tried this mouse and the pain has completely disappeared. My wrist still gets a little tired on occasion but I haven't had any pain since I started using it. I even bought a second one to use at home after trying it out at work for a couple months. It's definitely expensive for a mouse but to me it was worth it to finally get rid of the pain.",
