      "reviewText": "assembled easy out of the box. flame control is pretty impressive, it will really roar and get things boiling, and it will go down to a whisper of a flame and not go out. The grate is welded on, so cleaning will be a problem. this was a good purchase. I have a lot of outdoor stoves, ranging from backpacking tiny, to butane gas range, to turkey fryer style- this one has all the elements you are looking for in a compact yet large portable stove. I just wish i had bought this 5 or 6 years ago.",
