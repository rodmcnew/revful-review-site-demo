      "reviewText": "I had been looking at this lens for quite some time and decided that it was too expensive for my uses. I got lucky and received one as a gift and have had so much fun with the lens! I particularly love taking night landscape photos, and this lens is unbelievable for that purpose. The lens cap (as evident reading other 3rd party reviews) is absolutely terrible. From the first time I removed the lens from the box the cap came right off. It barely stays on with normal use. If the camera is around your neck and you hop, the Cap falls off. Great lens, very frustrating lens cap (exasperated by the fact that no UV lens cap can be used with the fisheye design).",

      "reviewText": "Have had lens for 3 months. When I discovered this great lens I immediately looked for reviews. Do to the earthquake in Japan it came to market slowly. I found a supplier with the right price and made the purchase. This is my third fisheye lens and it is beyond my expectations. First test the gorge in Watkins Glen, NY. Used it for stills and unbelievable video on my 7d. Showed results to friends and coworkers who were WOWed! How did you do that was the #1 remark. The versitality in tight spaces is remarkable.",

      "reviewText": "This is the most used and fun to shoot with lens that I own. There were a lot of delays to get this on the market but it was worth the wait. I find all the images are sharp and the focus speed and build quality are fantastic. The only reason I gave the features a 4 out of 5 stars is because the lens cap and hood system are sort of clunky and the cap can easily fall off. I find myself not using the hood either because it shows in the photos. Other than that I have ZERO complaints about this lens.",
