They are only rated for 250 pounds but feel very sturdy. They also have a really nice thick plastic frame underneath with holes and screws for mounting. I also bought a casting seat and post for bass fishing!",

Ordering was easy and the transaction was complete without a hitch. Should the need arise I would shop Walmart online again",
