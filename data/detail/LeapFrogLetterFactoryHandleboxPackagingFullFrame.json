      "reviewText": "We have always had LeapFrog:Letter Factory in our family. We discovered it when our oldest, now 16 years old, was 4 years old. Eight children (ages 16 to 15 months) and 12 years later, we still highly recommend this DVD. We had to repurchase because our old one had gotten scratched up.\n\nWe homeschool, so every day during the 3, 4 and 5 year old age range each of our children would enjoy Leap Frog as part of their daily school time.\n\nAfter we saw that they clearly could recognized their letters, write their letters and identify the sounds of their letters with Letter Factory, we then moved on to Leap Frog: Code Caper.\n\nAll of our children have learned to read or will learn to read with the help of Leap Frog: Letter Factory and Code Caper. :)\n\nWith the engaging music, the funny way to learn the phonics of each letter and the story line helps to make learning phonics fun, easy and effortless.\n\nLeap Frog: Letter Factory is truly a *must have.*",
