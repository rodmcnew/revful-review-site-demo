      "reviewText": "This is the second case I have had with two of my 4s's. It protected beyond all my expectations for the full life of my first phone. This new one is just as good. They didn't hae it in white this time, but the hot pink is ok. Protects well from occasional splashes and spills. If I had any complaint, it is just that an occasional piece of lint gets under the screen protector somehow, but not a hard fix. Superb protection, well worth the cost.",
