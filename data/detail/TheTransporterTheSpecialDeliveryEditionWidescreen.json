I have seen this movie at least a dozen times.\n\nI love love love this film. It is loaded with action, a great plot, fast cars, martial arts and one of my favorite actors. You will easily be addicted to the character and will purchase Tranporter 2.\n\nYou cant beat the price or the quality either. A great movie, for a great price, such a deal! Enjoy and get the popcorn ready!",
