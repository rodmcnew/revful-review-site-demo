Does go off sometimes if you walk to close to it but not a problem for me. Plus my kids love throwing things away now. Great trash can for the home especiallyif you have a large family.",

The price was more than I wanted to pay, but I figured after wanting it for 3 years, and not finding a better deal anywhere else, I should just break down and get it. Finally, I don't have to change my trash twice a day.",
