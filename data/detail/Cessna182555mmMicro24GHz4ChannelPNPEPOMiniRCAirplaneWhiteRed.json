I then ordered another one and when it arrived it did not have a controller.\nI took both back to WalMart and was given credit for the purchase, but WalMart should check this vendor and see if this might be happening with other items.",

What a rip off Walmart! Had to take it back for a refund because they didn't carry it in the store. Very disappointing.",
