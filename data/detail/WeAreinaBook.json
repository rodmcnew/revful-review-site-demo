I thought I had already gotten this book for her. When I discovered that I hadn't, I ordered it right away. We've been reading Elephant & Piggie books for a long time. We really enjoy the Pigeon books, too. Now that she is 5, she can read most all them herself!",

      "reviewText": "LOVE Mo Willems!!! All of Mr. Willems series' (knuffle bunny, pigeon, and piggie & elephant) have helped my 8yr old autistic son with his reading. He was never a fan of Dr. Seuss and it wasn't until we came across Mo Willems did his interest in reading really take off. Plus, not only are the character's facial expressions absolutely hilarious, they aide my son in recognizing expression and the meaning behind it - something the autistic community struggles to understand. Thank you Mr. Willems in helping to foster my son's confidence in his reading and in himself!!!",

      "reviewText": "I bought this book originally for my son in a book store because it had won a readers award. I read this book once and my son who was 5 at the time loved it and asked for me to read it again. We fell in love with the Elephant and Piggie series and we now own them all and read at least one to three books a night in addition to other books. We love the series and recommend this book and others in the series to other beginner readers. I bought this book as a gift for my son's kindergarten class.\nI love that Walmart offers a chance for you to pick five books for 25 dollars, that's a deal for hard cover books and it beats buying the series indivdually and it saves you several dollars per book. Shipping to my house was also very reasonable.",
