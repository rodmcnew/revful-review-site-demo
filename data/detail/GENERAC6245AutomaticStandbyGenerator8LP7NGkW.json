      "reviewText": "We have had several power outages and our Generac generator starts automatically within a few seconds each and every time. The generator will run until the power comes back on and automatically turns itself off. We love the fact that we never have to fill a fuel tank. Our Generac generator is conected to the natural gas line that comes to our home. Our Generac generator automatically test start and runs for ten minutes every week. We are one and a half year proud and very pleased Generac generator owners. Thank you Generac for making an economical worry free product.",
