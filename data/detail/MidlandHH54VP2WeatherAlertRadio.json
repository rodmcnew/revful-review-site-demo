      "reviewText": "We moved to tornado country and needed to buy a weather-alert radio. We had two criteria when trying to find a weather-alert radio. We needed one that was strong enough to find a weather station for our remote area; and we needed one that would AUTOMATICALLY alert us of approaching storms. This radio works! We have set it for \"Voice\" alert and keep it in it's charger that is plugged in at the head of the bed. When a storm approaches our area, the radio automatically sends a loud ringing signal that lasts for approximately eight seconds; then the National Weather Service alert message is broadcast for five minutes while the digital screen displays a visual message. Since the radio itself is handheld, we are able to take it out of it's charger and head down into the basement to ride out the storm and listen for information. The radio is preset to warn of approaching hazards within a large radius; or from 1 to 9 counties may be programmed. We would highly recommend this radio!",

      "reviewText": "Bought this radio a few weeks ago due to the one we had was huge and didn't have hazard alerts. This little hand held baby you turn on set in charger and leave until you her the tone. Red light lights up and a message scrolls. Turn weather radio on to hear warnings etc.. It's simple and really easy to use. Takes up so little space as well. Uses regular batteries and comes complete with battery pack and charger. It's been going off all day with tornado sightings and water spouts.",

      "reviewText": "Love this little handheld alert radio. Love that it is portable, so when a storm strikes I can grab and go. I love that you can program certain codes into your radio to only alarm when there are watches or warnings in your area. It's loud enough that you can hear it in another room.Love that you can carry it with you in the car, on your stroller, or on your belt.",

      "reviewText": "This is a nice little radio with lots of features. Unfortunately I had to return it as it did not receive any signal inside my RV. Worked fine when I stepped outside, but I mainly wanted it for overnight warnings while in the RV. Did not even receive signal when held up to window. The instuction book warns that it might not be as effective inside a mobile home because of metal exterior.",
