      "reviewText": "I've had this ukulele for 2 years, so I know it inside out. It's great ukulele and with good strings sounds as good as ukes costing 3-4 times as much, and anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong. While tone can vary from instrument to instrument, all the OU2's I've ever listened to and/or played, sound fine.\n\nOne thing I'll point out, is the Walmart product description is wrong. The headstock is not Ebony, that would actually be the wrong wood for the headstock anyway. I think whoever wrote the copy meant the fretboard . . .which is not ebony anyway, it's just stained ebony. An Ebony fretboard alone would cost about the price of this entire instrument. The bridge isn't ebony either, some hardwood stained ebony. But don't let that stop you from buying this instrument.\n\nAlso, there IS no body binding on this instrument, you can actually see that in the picture. But if you want a quality ukulele that is worth twice the price, you can't go wrong with an Oscar Schmidt OU2. I have tried a few different strings on this instrument, my favorite sound comes from Martin Fluorocarbon strings. The stock strings are \"okay\" but to really open this uke up, try the Martin Strings or Aquila Titaniums.",

Found the same instrument on other websites for about twice the price, so I'd say that it's totally worth it to order off of walmart.",
