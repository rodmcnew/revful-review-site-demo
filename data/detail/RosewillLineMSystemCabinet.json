      "reviewText": "Pros:\n* Small mATX tower case\n* USB 3.0\n* Holds everything I needed it to (HDD, SSD, DVD drive, USB card reader, PSU, FM2+ MoBo)\n* Not ridiculous looking (very basic appearance)\n* Comes with a speaker to hook up to your MoBo for debugging\n* Comes with all black screws\n* Comes with black zip ties\n* Can fit a Cooler Master 212 (though not with side vent fans)\n\nCons: There are a few small negatives to the case, but none insurmountable:\n* Tight working area\n* Top-heavy build (50/50 my fault and cases fault)\n* Not a lot of room for cable management\n\nYou can route the PSU mother board cable on the back side and tuck it in as much as possible to hide the slack. You can also route the CPU power cable around the top mounted PSU to reduce and hide slack as well.\n\nI would suggest to mount any 3.5 HDD on the bottom to reduce the weight on the top. You will need to use cable ties to tidy cable management for cleaner look.\n\nWould suggest to use a semi-modular PSU to reduce clutter such as the Corsair CX430M or similar.\n\nOverall a value case for a budget build or even a entry level gaming case.",
