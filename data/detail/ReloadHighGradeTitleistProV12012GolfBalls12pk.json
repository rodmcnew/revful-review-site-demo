The quick, excellent, friendly service given me (who placed the order) however, deserves an A+. I have ordered on-line to store on several occasions, and have always received the same courteous, excellent service with quick receipt of items ordered.\n\nThis should say it all.......keep up the good work and service......that's what makes people, like me, coming back over and over again.",

      "reviewText": "Well I golf over 100 rounds a summer and regularly use pro v1 and pro v1x but 50 bucks for a dozen is absolutely ridiculous. I have bought these before in the past and they seemed to work fine. At the end of last year they were on sale at Walmart for 19.95 or around that and thought I'll get some for next year put them in my bag that was indoors all winter and went to play the other day and noticed the ball I was hitting had a giant tumor on it! Then I looked through some of the other ones and found another ball that had the same lump on it. Also many golfers who want to check how soft the ball is (like a prov1x) you bite the ball to see how soft it is, so I bit one of them and the ball literally cracked! Completely useless golf balls you may as well consider those Top Flites. Unfortunately I most likely will not purchase those again.",
