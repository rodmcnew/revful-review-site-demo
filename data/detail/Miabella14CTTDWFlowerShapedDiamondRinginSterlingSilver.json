      "reviewText": "I ordered this ring because it matched a gorgeous set of earrings I bought my niece for her 18th Birthday, this would be for her 21st. I was sssooo excited to get it. Until I opened it. I think I almost cried. The shank was so thin I would be afraid for her to grab anything. The setting, although very cute, was small in itself but so small it was hard to tell there were 3 separate \"flowers\". In a case like this I think I would be fair to show it next to a coin, or on a hand because the picture is quite misleading. Ok...I paid $60 for it, but even at that it wasn't worth it. I definitely returned it on the spot #site to store perk!#. It would be perfect for a young girl maybe 7-10yr range but certainly not for a woman. Will it prevent me from shopping Walmart online or in store..NO WAY..I'll always be a customer.",
