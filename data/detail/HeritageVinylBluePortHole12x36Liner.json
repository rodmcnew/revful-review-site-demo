This liner was a little thinner then what I had before, but after shopping ALL over the web it was the best price.",

      "reviewText": "The pool liner, was baught as second replacement.\nThe original liner with pool lasted 3 years.\nThe second liner also from Walmart, looked near same as original, but the liner became crumbly in areas over the winter, had to be thrown away.\nThis third liner, I was forced to by at walmart too, as I could not find a replacement any where else, at reasonable price.\nIt was slightly to small, it is verry thin, has no drain hole, and did not come with the coping strip to hold liner in place.\nI had to realy stretch the liner, to get it to go over the rim of the pool, using lots of cloths line pins to hold it in place.\nI came up with idea of using the vacuum hand tool, placed in the empty waterlet hole of outer shell, to suck the liner tight to ground and sidewalls of the pool.\nI could not find the top coping anywhere, so I used a huge box of small binder clips, to hold the liner in place.\nAnd used small diameter inslated slitted pip covering, over the top rim of the pool, hiding all those steel clips.",
