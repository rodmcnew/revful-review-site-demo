It actually looks better and has some teal coloring in it as well that you can't see in pic. Price was great for the set and it fits and looks great on the daybed.",

The skirt focused on the darker colors from the comforter.\nEven though it does not look the same online as it does in real life, I was very pleased with the set. It was purchased for my spare bedroom, and it looks great!\nThe price was also reasonable.",

I saw the same set for sale elsewhere for $50.00 more! The only disappointment was the bed skirt was not the color pictured. It came in the dark brown tones, not the cream tones as I was expecting. I wanted the cream because of the dog. But it all looks great. I would recommend the overall quality.",
