My family had a wonderful time playing this classic game. The quality was incredible, almost too pretty to play with. In my book this game is a $50 value for the low price of $15. I am so glad I bought it.",

      "reviewText": "The board is well made and for the price and exceptional purchase. I would recommend it with the following considerations; The board even though well made is on the small size and could be a little larger. Also the board is not painted resulting in a few problems when 6 players are playing ( you lose vision of the area you are trying to reach; they all look the same. Te marbles are unique colors and would have been better served if the were bright basic colors.\n\nNow with that said, would I purchase this product again; yes I would. We've already had allot of fun playing and using it.",
