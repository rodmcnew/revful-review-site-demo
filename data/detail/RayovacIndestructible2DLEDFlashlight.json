      "reviewText": "Even though the description says 140, this IS the 250 lumens version. It's incredibly; almost painfully bright & the power saver mode can be handy in the middle of the night if you want a less blinding beam. It well built & has a solid & hefty feel. The anodized aluminum body can sometimes feel slippery in your hands, but the rubber ends allow for a solid grip. My only complaint is the beam isn't adjustable.",
