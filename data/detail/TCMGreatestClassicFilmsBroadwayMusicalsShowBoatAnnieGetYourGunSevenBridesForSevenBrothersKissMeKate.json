      "reviewText": "I was impressed to find this pack of movies. For less than $5 each you get Kiss Me Kate, 7 Brides for 7 Brothers, Show Boat, and Annie Get Your Gun. Some of these movies are hard to find, and some retail for $20 each elsewhere. Not all of them are in Widescreen, but some of them, such as Kiss Me Kate was never made in a widescreen version. I highly recommend this for someone who loves musical classics and Howard Keel's booming voice.",
