Already had a key for 8.1 pro and I upgraded from bing home OS in a jiffy. This little thing is perfect for any small office business! Nice little form factor, I think I may slap another 4GB of ram into it for 20 dollars!",

      "reviewText": "This computer has been nothing but great since I have purchased it. I had an old computer from 2007, 512mb ram, single core that I paid about 299.00 at Office Depot, and it was slow, would always freeze, and when I saw this Acer for 248.00 with quad core, and 4 GB of Ram, there was no turning back. I installed it in about 15 minutes, and it never freezes on me, and I can read my newspapers without having it freeze up on me, then having to go back time and time again to finish the news article. I'm cheap so this is right up my alley. And, as far as the McAfee internet security that's installed for one month free after you purchase the computer, I purchased a year service for about 20.00, and it's been working fine, even though I hear nothing but bad things about McAfee. This is a keeper, and I'll hold on to it for as long as I can. Thank you Walmart and Acer!",

This is the 1st computer I bought\nwithout a monitor. I had a 23 inch monitor and I saved about $100.00. Great price.",

The only problem is that the computer doesn't come with built in Wi-Fi. I purchased a usb Wi-Fi adapter with the computer at walmart. It was a breeze to install it. A great computer for those who use a computer for light applications. So far no complaints.",
