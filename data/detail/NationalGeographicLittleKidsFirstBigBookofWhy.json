      "reviewText": "Great book, my 4 year old grandbaby loves the pictures. Lots of questions and great answers. Only one issue, on page 18 there is the question of why does grandma have wrinkles. I have known a few grandmas and a few kids in my day, and never once have I ever heard any child ask that question. Kids usually don't think of stuff like that on their own, they just love you for being you. Why not just talk about the shar-pei (dog) and leave the grandmas out of it?",
