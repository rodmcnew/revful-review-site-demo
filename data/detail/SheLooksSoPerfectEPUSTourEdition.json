      "reviewText": "This EP is the first of 5 Seconds of Summer to be released in America.... and it was definitely worth the wait! 5 Seconds of Summer, an alternative punk band from Australia, is widely known for opening for One Direction on their Take Me Home Tour last year. However, do not let this misguide you. Luke Hemmings, Calum Hood, Michael Clifford, and Ashton Irwin sound nothing like One Direction. Their edgy and catchy songs are sure to soon be a hit and take over America as they have in Australia, UK, Ireland, and many other places.\n\nIf you don't get this EP, trust me. You're missing out. This is one of the best EP's I've ever heard.\n\nAs said in one of their previous songs [Unpredictable to be exact], they really are \"taking on the world.\"",
