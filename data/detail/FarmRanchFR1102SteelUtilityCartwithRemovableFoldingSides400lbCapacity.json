This cart makes it easy to bring in groceries, bottled water, pop, etc. and still does not take a lot of room between uses. The pneumatic tires roll easy. It was not hard to put together.",

      "reviewText": "My cart has many uses and that is why I purchased it. I live in Indianapolis, In. but I am from Los Angeles, California where public transportation is more rapid. I do not own a car and the laundry mat and grocery stores are in walking distance but not for carrying a lot of heavy bags. I use my cart for grocery shopping, laundry, and basic carrying needs. The public loves it! Where ever I go strangers say, \"That is a good idea!\" They call it my \"adult wagon\"! I say, \"I got this from Wall Mart and I love it! I get great exercise walking and my adult son gets a kick out of sitting in it! (He thinks I will pull him in it like when he was a kid! (big smile)). I could if I wanted to because it has a 400 lb capacity and is very sturdy. I literally have people double take their looks when I strut on by with my sassy walk pulling my wagon! This has been my best purchase so far this year. The one suggestion I do have is making the instructions on how to put it together easier to understand or have an accurate assembly tutorial \"you tube\" video for it. Other than that, I am very satisfied with my \"adult wagon!\"",
