      "reviewText": "These are little boxes of delicate, tangy-sweet cookies, great to have on hand for a) gift giving (along with a box of variety teas), b) serving along with tea or coffee to guests, and/or c) enjoying as a snack for yourself! I've had the lime, lemon & raspberry varieties. Lime and lemon are a bit more tart than the raspberry, but all 3 varieties are delicious and always a welcomed treat. I keep them on hand exactly for the purposes stated above. Buying them in boxes of 12 packs is the best deal. They have a long shelf life (come in aluminum foil bag inside the box), so it's highly unlikely that your purchase would become stale before eating or giving as gifts. Nice addition to any food gift (with teas, or even with a fruit basket). Highly recommend.",
