      "reviewText": "I have been searching for some dining chairs that would not start breaking down after a year of regular use. My home is traditional, country style decorated and the wooden windsor chair has been what I have used for years. They match my decor and style. BUT they all start creaking and falling apart after a while. I live in New England where the humidity can be very high in the summer. I use a woodstove all winter so this makes for a lot of shrinking and swelling of the wooden frame chairs from year to year. I have been looking for a metal chair that would fit my style and budget and these black metal schoolhouse back chairs do the trick. They are very sturdy and I know they will withstand the wear and tear of my family through all of the extremes. I started with two, just to make sure I would like the way they look. I am here to buy 4 more. Hopefully I will never have to buy dining chairs again! I also want to add that I purchased some round \"braided rug\" seat pads to soften up the look of the chairs and I really am pleased with how they fit in to my decor.",

      "reviewText": "These chairs are built very solid. They are heavy too.(but not too heavy)\nThey are already put together too. All you have to do is install 4 screws in the bottom of the seat where it fastens to the frame of the chair. Very simple and fast...I had all 4 chairs out of the boxes and put together in about a half hour.\nThey are well packed too...boxes are just as solid as the chairs. You won't be sorry!",

Large family members can sit in them and the kids can not destroy them. I bought four and want more. Assembly is simply putting on the seats. I am VERY pleased!",

I needed to use a drill and screwdriver and buy 2 packages of wood screws. I would also recommend getting chair pads as this will add comfort and height.",
