      "reviewText": "There was some confusion of the \"4-pack\". Yes, I did get 4 individual sleeves of 110x110 batting after the very helpful Walmart woman saw the internet order. It seems the UPC code of the \"4-pack\" is the same as the \"single\". Walmart needs to get that corrected for this item as well as for several other batting \"4-pack\" and \"3-pack\" items. This is very nice batting, with an even loft and no bunching. I actually got 6 blankets out of each 110x110 roll and for the price it worked very well in the baby blankets I made. I will definitely purchase the Morning Glory brand again.",

      "reviewText": "I know a lot of people ordered this and only received one 110 x 110 roll of the batting, but I think Walmart has finally cleared up the confusion. I received all 4 rolls of 110 x 110 batting in a large box. The box had a sticker on the top for the employees that basically said to not separate the rolls because it is sold as a \"set\", so to speak. You really cannot beat the price for 4 huge rolls of batting! I will definitely purchase this again for future projects!",
