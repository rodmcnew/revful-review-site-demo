      "reviewText": "After trying every dandruff shampoo (even prescribed shampoos by my doctor) I have finally found a solution for my severe dandruff. The secret is in the 2% zinc formula. Unfortunately my local store does not carry this item in stock, but I am happy to have the choice to order it. I've tried the 1%, which did not work. I've tried the 2% with a shampoo that was prescribed by my doctor, which only helped for a short time. I am so happy that after one year of use of this Head and Shoulders 2%zinc shampoo, my dandruff is still gone. I previously even tried all kinds of natural remedies, like tea tree oil, listerine etc. etc. for so many years and I hope my review helps someone to give this a try and hopefully find a solution like I did with this shampoo.",
