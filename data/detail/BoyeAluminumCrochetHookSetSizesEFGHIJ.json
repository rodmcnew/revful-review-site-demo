      "reviewText": "Okay so i dont write reviews very often, and never have for walmart. but decided since there are really no reviews that tell how great this product was i should.\n\nThese are my first crochet hooks i was going to buy so i did research on the brand and heard boye is one of the best you can get. I ordered these expecting them in 10 days.. i received them in 5 i was extatic!! i started my project that night (actually tonight lol) right when i got after work when i got them.\n\nNow to the review of the product.. i didnt expect that they would come in a package that has different sections for each hook..and i loved that!! i feel like i dont have to get a hook pouch for this set cause its already in there own seperaters. Like i said before it was my first project but they do have a great variety of hooks for a great price. they glide great and i was able to finish a quarter of my project with ease.\n\nI will DEFINITLY be buying boye again and most likely through walmart because shipping was so so so quick..i ordered late saturday night and received it that wednesday, thats 3 business days!!so Awesome!!! I think i am still giddy about it all after 5 hours :)))",
