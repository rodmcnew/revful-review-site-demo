      "reviewText": "I bought the capris so I had to get these shorts as well.They fit just as good as the other faded glory denim that has a bit of stretch in them.No muffin top and gives me a slimmer appearance.The price is right but am surprised there is no description about them.I have had a love/hate relationship with denim for years because I could never find anything that fit me right until now.They fit right at the waist for a comfortable fit and the length of the shorts are right below the knee.This is the only brand I will ever purchase now.",

      "reviewText": "These shorts of seriously the most comfortable and flattering shorts I've ever worn. They don't shrink much, if at all, in the wash and they are super slimming. The waist goes up high enough to tuck you in in all the right places and the length covers my knee caps (I'm 5'4''). I would say they fit true to size so whatever your current pant size is, get these in that same size. They are stretchy and soft and don't cut into you at all. LOVE these. I own two pair and will be getting a third in a different wash.",
