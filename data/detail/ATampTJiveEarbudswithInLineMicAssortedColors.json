I bought my first pair 2 yrs ago and always wanted to get a couple more pairs. They don't tangle and are really durable. LOVE LOVE LOVE them so much I just bought 4 more pairs. Highly recommend these!!",

I've only used them for my tablet while watching movies so I don't know how they would work if using on a phone. If something ever happened to them I would buy another pair.",

If you want good sound at a cheap price, then these are for you. My children are always taking mine, and somehow I never get them back. These are cheap enough that I can replace them often, without compromising on the sound quality.",
