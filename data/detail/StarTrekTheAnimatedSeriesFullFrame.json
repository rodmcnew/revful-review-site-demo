It has almost all of the actors from the show doing the voices, which is a huge plus. If you're a true TOS/Star Trek fan, you'll enjoy this, and it'll be worth the money.",

      "reviewText": "It seems like receiving an item with no damage is hit or miss. The first one I ordered was damaged. The DVD set was put in a bubble envelop mailer and sent on a 3-4 week journey through UPS to get to my local Walmart. Not a big deal since Walmart let me return it right at the customer service counter in the store. I ordered a second one and It took 3 weeks for it to arrive. Its not the fastest service so if you are in a rush the site to store may not be your best option. I was surprised however when the second DVD set arrived it was packed in a box and then a bubble mailer.\nGreat Job. Set was perfect. Hopefully this was not some fluke and Walmart is starting to use more secure packaging.",
