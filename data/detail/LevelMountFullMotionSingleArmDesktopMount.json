      "reviewText": "Got it all together from the limited instructions after about 30 minutes. Bolted it on the table and the screen was not level. Saw no way to level it, The adjustments tilting forward and backward would not hold properly so it kept tilting down. Returned item and bought the NEO-Flex. What a big difference. The Neo-Flex was easy to assemble and works so much easier, they put a lot of thought into making the NEO-Flex.",
