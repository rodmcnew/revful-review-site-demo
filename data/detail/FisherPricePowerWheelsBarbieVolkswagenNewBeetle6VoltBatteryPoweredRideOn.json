      "reviewText": "My {two} year old has always loved our older daughter's Jeep but her feet couldn't reach the pedals so we knew after lots of research this would be perfect for our little girls second birthday because she has a door to get in and out of and she can reach the pedals. It's perfect size and works great outside and inside. Wonderful Product. The only problem was getting the stickers on.. They are horrible to get on perfect. Other than that it's an awesome product!",
