Packaging was a very neat. The device its self is a little bigger than I had thought tho the camera device is sleek and clean I love the look. My fiance is very pleased with my buy just wish he knew how long to charge battery for over all we will enjoy this video baby monitor to the fullest great product!",

Image quality is pretty good. Gets a little distorted with zoom but the pan right left up down is key! Overall good monitor. ",
