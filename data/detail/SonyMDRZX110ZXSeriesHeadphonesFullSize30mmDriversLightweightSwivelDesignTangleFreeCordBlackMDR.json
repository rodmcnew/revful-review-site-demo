      "reviewText": "I got a set of these headphones and I expected it to be just like all the other headphones you buy that sound bad in this price range, but I wanted to get a set of headphones to use with my smartphone to listen to my music.\n\nUpon buying it, and plugging it in...and playing my first song...I was UNBELIEVABLY SURPRISED to find out that the headphones actually KICK BUTT!!!...I mean don't get me wrong, I have had much better sounding headphones, but I have also paid $200+ for them!!.\n\nThese headphones honestly sound VERY good, and to add yet a bonus to them, which i didn't even realize until after I had bought them...but you can use them with your smartphone to actually make phone calls!!\n\nNot only do the headphones make the people you are calling sound VERY good, much better than even using the phone by itself (in stereo etc)...but the microphone that it has allows the people you call to hear YOU very clearly !!!\n\nSo beyond using the headphones to listen to music on my smartphone, I envision using them ALL THE TIME to make phone calls etc.\n\nI must say, GREAT WORK SONY !!!\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend these headphones people !\n\nOh yea...they are very comfortable as well..unlike a lot of headphones that tend to hurt after wearing them for an extended period of time....good stuff !",
