One application of the Dense Shade mix and some starter fertilizer brought new life to our lawn! I would recommend this to anyone who has a lot of shade and maybe not-so perfect soil. Works the first time!",

      "reviewText": "We bought our house a year ago and the grass was awful. Most of our yard is shaded by mature trees. I reseeded part of the backyard with dense shade mix to see how it would do. I sprayed the yard, waited a week, raked out the dead weeds, and then put down seed and starter fertilizer. I put the seed down later in the fall than I would've liked but it came in. I put some winterguard down before it got really cold and then waited until spring. I've been following the Scott's feeding schedule and I've got lush green grass in that area now. My only criticism is that 7lbs is the largest size bag they sell of dense shade mix.",

This grass grew in every spot that I had sewn it on. It looks great now. I definitely don't miss that bare area of my yard. Now all this spot needs is some turf builder to thicken things up a little. Thanks Scott's for a good product",

      "reviewText": "I live in St. Louis, Missouri with hot 90-100 degree summers, humid weather, and cold winters. My front lawn is shaded by huge sycamore trees, and gets essentially no direct sunlight. In addition there is a ornamental spruce tree in the front. This grass sprouted and is growing even under the spruce tree (ie, under the shade of TWO trees). I planted in early spring with a top coat of compost. Watered daily for about 5 minutes until 2 weeks after the grass sprouted. Had nice thick growth throughout the lawn, already on the third mowing. Love this grass so far! We will see how it makes it through a Midwest summer...",
