As these pants are not so expensive I can size down when need be. They are not high waisted like so many of the other brands. These pants are a slim fit, not really a legging as described. The petiets are a great length for my height of 5'1\", they are my go to, every day pants.",

These pants (leggings) were a perfect choice! The fit is stylish, slimming through the legs, yet have a nice stretch around my middle and they're a true petite too! And the price was awesome!!!",
