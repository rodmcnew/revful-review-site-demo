      "reviewText": "It will help keep you healthy. I had 3 Sharp air purifier sitting at various location in the house. The previous one that I bought, has been kept on 24/7 for the past 5 year without any defect or issue. A model like this one use to costs much higher. Now it is much more affordable. There is a lower Sharp air purifier model available, but the saving isn't worth the value & quality you get.\n\nThis model requires filter change every 6 months. The new developed filter works well capturing odors & dusts. So it is worth it because it helps keeping air you breath at optimum level.",

I've only had it for about 3 weeks so I can't comment on it's long term operation. So far it's great.",

You no longer smell that in my home,for real ! I'm not kidding you. Now I may have to buy filters more but I don't care as long as it keeps up the good work. Now I did how ever wash my walls down and had the rugs cleaned so I would have a clean place for it to do the job. But now I can say,no more smell!!! Well, I got to run ! I need a smoke !!! Hay, get it ! You'll love it !!!",

Before I purchased this unit I had a problem breathing the stale air, we keep our bedroom door closed to\neliminate any noise from my many grandfather clocks. This unit is ultra quite on the\nlow setting which is great for a bedroom while you sleep.",
