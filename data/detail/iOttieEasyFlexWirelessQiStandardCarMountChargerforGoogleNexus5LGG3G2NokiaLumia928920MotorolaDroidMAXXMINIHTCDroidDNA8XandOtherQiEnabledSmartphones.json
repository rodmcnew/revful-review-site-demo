      "reviewText": "The device mounts well and holds well on the dash. It does require a deliberate opening that for some can be 2 hands, for me it is 1. Mounting is quick , easy and secure. The charger works well with my droid turbo, however it essentially provides enough power to keep the phone at an even charge level when display, GPS and streaming are going on.\n\nBut here are the issues, the wireless charging interferes with my vehicles RF systems. In my case the F150. It reduces the range of the keyless entry button essentially it still works at the windows. Then it periodically causes the TPS system to error dinging a warning while driving. (Tire Pressure warning System) . Both these things run on the 315 MHz band. When I unplug the charger these problems are gone.\n\nI live with these knowing the limitations but may cause confusion or more inconvenience for others.",

      "reviewText": "This thing actually increases the charge in my phone while the screen is on and two or three programs run. Not like my old charger that that would leave me with a near dead battery after 4 hours on the road.\nI love the \"gel\" suction cup. It sticks to a rounded edge on my textured dash where I would never be able to stick a regular one.\nI wish they could put a heat dissipating pad on it though. My phone gets pretty warm when it charges, and navigates, and streams music, and sends the music over Bluetooth, and talks to my car's ECM. Lack of ventilation drops a star.",
