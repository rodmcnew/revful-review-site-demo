      "reviewText": "This was given to my husband as a gift, since he was so fond of \"Band of Brothers\". Since this was a Spielberg/Tom Hanks production, he expected the same quality and was deeply disappointed. The story was supposed to be a documentary, but it turned out to be more of a soap opera--very shallow in comparison to BoB, with superficial plot lines. Each disc was only about 40 minutes long, which was a distinct surprise. We felt that the respect for the Marines' efforts and sacrifice in \"Pacific\" was clouded by the \"boy-girl\" relationship stories. Sorry- just not what we expected!",
